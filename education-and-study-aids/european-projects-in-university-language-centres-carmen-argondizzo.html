  <title>European Projects in University Language Centres - Carmen Argondizzo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume offers a collection of best practices carried out in university contexts with the aim of highlighting the relevant role that Language Centres play in the field of language learning and the benefit they receive from European project planning. Issues such as intercomprehension, integration and diversity, interlinguistic models in disadvantaged migration contexts, audio description, cinema and translation as well as crosscurricular studies for university students, learners’ assessment, the promotion of plurilingualism in enterprises and in the legal field are tackled with special attention on the theoretical and practical dimensions that projects need to consider during the planning, implementation and dissemination actions. The variety of topics shows the daily liveliness that University Language Centres experience and the energy that they offer to the national and international communities. Thus the final chapter attentively explores strategies of Quality Assurance which further enhance the value of team work and project work within and beyond the academic context. This has the aim of promoting both cooperation that crosses geographical boundaries as well as quality in project dynamics which encourages a wide-angled multilingual and multicultural perspective." />
