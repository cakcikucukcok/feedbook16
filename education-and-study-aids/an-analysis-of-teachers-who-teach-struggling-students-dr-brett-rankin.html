  <title>An Analysis of Teachers Who Teach Struggling Students - Dr. Brett Rankin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After many years of reform efforts, educators are still searching for ways to better serve the needs of struggling students. The purpose of this study was to develop a grounded theory (GT) that reflects teachers&#39; perceptions of students&#39; behavior, students&#39; needs for support, and students&#39; skill deficiencies. Discovering the ways in which teachers address students&#39; needs could sharpen teacher practices and promote support for struggling students. Guided by Weimer&#39;s research on learner-centered teaching, this GT study created a conceptual understanding of classroom experiences from teachers&#39; perspective. Three main categories or stages emerged from this GT study, with each stage representing a conceptual rendering of behaviors one can expect when working with struggling students in a similar setting. This theory can be useful to educators considering how best to work with struggling students by revealing the patterns of behavior among teachers who serve struggling students." />
