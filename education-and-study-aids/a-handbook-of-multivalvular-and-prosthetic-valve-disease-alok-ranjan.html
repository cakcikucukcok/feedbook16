  <title>A Handbook of Multivalvular and Prosthetic Valve Disease - Alok Ranjan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A Handbook of Multivalvular and Prosthetic Valve Disease&quot; contains a detailed description of the disease.  There are no clear cut guidelines about management of multivalvular disease.  However, author has tried to deal in simple and comprehensible manner.  Special effort has been made to explain the clinical features (Symptoms and signs) of multivalvular disease and to decide about dominant lesion in each case.  Likewise, the prosthetic valve evaluation has also been dealt in great details in this book.  Readers will find it very useful as current books lack a detailed description of prosthetic valves.  Prosthetic valve dysfunction, its assessment and management is again highlight of this handbook.  The treatment section includes description about the various interventions (catheter based as well as surgical) and it also includes the ACC / AHA guidelines whereever possible.  
  All in all, the book promises to be a great reference book for multivalvular and prosthetic Valve Disease and is worth having it on shelf for easy reading.  Pointwise and concise writing has made this book specially useful for students and exam going students." />
