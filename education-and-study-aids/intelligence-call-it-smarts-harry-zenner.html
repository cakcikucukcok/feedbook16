  <title>Intelligence Call It Smarts - Harry Zenner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="INTELLIGENCE Call It SMARTS
Update Yourself - Step by Step
Many individuals are aware there are cracks and moral challenges, or worse, in American society. These persons do not require convincing; they see it. They know American culture has declined, possibly nearing moral and financial self-destruction. There are obvious reasons behind this state of the nations wellbeing. A distinct path is available that can lead towards a desirable resolution. The current down reality is entangled with education, moral decay, and a torrent of changes driven by technology.
Professor Zenners book sets forth an easy, painless process, step-by-step, building and supplementing the store of ideas, facts, and intelligence, call it Smarts, that the reader already possesses. Step after step, more lights will flicker on, not indoctrination, but the exact opposite, a freeing of the individuals thinking processes. Each new step builds on the last so that the ideas and information naturally integrate into the readers repertoire of reasoning abilities and intelligence. The final steps are designed to leave the individual with personal free will, choice, a moral compass, and perhaps wisdom. A society equipped with open minds, and when broadly educated, has the chance to evaluate the American political scene, its origins, current status, and its desired future.
The book is not a panacea, rather it is a sequenced, rational process of ideas and information that all of society would do well to examine. It will provide an excursion into new worlds for many, fresh perspectives for others, and an enriched life for most. The time to start this journey is now, mid-2012, least the nation wander too close to the edge, too close to a point of no return. That point of no return could be November 6, 2012.
Individuals are not that far out of touch, they need only a review of some things they may have forgotten, or perhaps things they never understood or knew. The narrative surveys the nature of the universe, of human origins and endeavors, learning abilities and techniques, math and argumentation, education, decision making, even philosophy and cosmology. Personal behaviors are also examined, from the individual right on up to the crowned heads of society in the United States.
Today, people have all kinds of questions. Where has the Future gone? Is the Climate Changing? Is the Earth Overcrowded? Is there even one Honest Politician? Does God actually exist? Is Mankind part of Mother Nature? How do you open a Closed Mind? How do people Learn? Where did the Universe come from? How did Life arise? How do humans Reason? What is the concept of Argumentation? What is meant by Real? How can Education be improved? What about Good and Evil? How much should you believe that emanates from the mouth of a Pathological Liar? Who will answer such questions? It may have to be individuals who have free and open minds, capable of independent thought. It will be people like you.
Professor Zenner shows that most of these questions have reasonable answers, some with certainty, and others with mere speculation. The writing provides basic tools for both inadequately and for highly educated persons to develop and judge their own answers. People who comprehend the human function of cognition are better able to understand themselves and the world which we all share.
Many people would like to be able to better reason and judge the accuracy of answers to the myriads of pertinent questions of our times. They want to believe in a better future. And you are one of those persons.
A PREVIEW
So Mr. Zenner, from the title of your book, you must realize that I already know a lot. No matter, you seem to think I need more smarts? And step by step, you will point the way; theyll be mine for the taking?
Thats right! Not just you, probably most persons in every society, especially at this particular time in America, you and all people need" />
