  <title>The Best Job In The World - Vic Goddard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is hard to imagine how one decision to make a TV series would lead to this. Vic Goddard says, &quot;As much as I have been uncomfortable at times through the last two years it is hard to be anything other than thankful that we did it. The school has grown stronger and even closer, the students have had some great opportunities and I have been lucky to learn so much and meet some amazing people.&quot; &quot;I really do love my job, who wouldn&#39;t? I get to work with committed professionals, for the most amazing energy givers in the world - my great young people at Passmores Academy and to be part of a community that strives to continually improve itself. I want my book to encourage teachers at all stages of their careers, and those considering entering the profession, to at least consider being a Headteacher. Day after day we hear and read about the pressures of being a Headteacher but we really don&#39;t hear enough about the pure joy of it. &quot;The journey from trainee/NQT to head can seem to be a long and often treacherous road, with many reasons to not travel it. I want to show you that it can be done (for those who know me well they are saying &#39;if Vic can do it anyone can!&#39;) and it can be done without losing your own passion and moral purpose.&quot; &quot;I want to share with you the pitfalls that I fell into in the hope that you can avoid them and share the amazing influences and experiences I have picked up on the way.&quot; Need we say more?" />
