  <title>The Misfits - Brandon Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brandon Clark, a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, discovered his professional purpose during a journey down the road less traveled: rehabilitation of children with behavior disorders. Clark artfully tackles the problems faced by children with special needs, highlighting the uphill battles these individuals face with America&amp;#39;s education system and how society treats those with disabilities, all the while challenging the reader to take a closer look under the surface of behavior disorders. Clark leads the reader on a high speed chase, raising important questions all too often ignored. In doing so, he becomes a strong voice for the unsung heroes: the parents, educators, social workers, and mental and behavior health professionals who encounter these unique children in their lives. This is a collection of his first hand experiences with emotionally disturbed children. It&amp;#39;s an enthralling account of the wildest events, the heartbreaking realities, the hilarious moments, and the tragic and true. His story spotlights one of America&amp;#39;s most unrecognized problems -- the disabled youth. This is a must read for anyone who comes in contact with the afflicted and disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;" />
