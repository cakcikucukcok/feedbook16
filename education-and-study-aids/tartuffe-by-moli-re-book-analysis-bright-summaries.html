  <title>Tartuffe by Molière (Book Analysis) - Bright Summaries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Unlock the more straightforward side of &lt;i&gt;Tartuffe &lt;/i&gt;with this concise and insightful summary and analysis!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This engaging summary presents an analysis of&lt;i&gt; Tartuffe&lt;/i&gt; by Molière, which is the most performed classical play of all time. This work humorously tells the story of a religious hypocrite who worms his way into a naïve man&#39;s good graces and ends up becoming a threat towards him. Upon its release, it caused great controversy with the many groups that were offended by the play, from upper-class French society members to the French Roman Catholic Church. Yet Molière justified his work and claimed it was simply a new approach to comedy that explored good and evil, right and wrong. To understand more about the controversy and to see why &lt;i&gt;Tartuffe &lt;/i&gt;is still so popular today, this is an unmissable read. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out everything you need to know about &lt;i&gt;Tartuffe&lt;/i&gt; in a fraction of the time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This in-depth and informative reading guide brings you:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;o A complete plot summary&lt;br&gt;o Character studies&lt;br&gt;o Key themes and symbols&lt;br&gt;o Questions for further reflection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why choose BrightSummaries.com?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Available in print and digital format, our publications are designed to accompany you in your reading journey.
