  <title>Teaching Assistant&#39;s Pocketbook - Dot Constable</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Just like teachers, TAs need proper induction, training and career development opportunities. The Teaching Assistant&#39;s Pocketbook supports this need by offering an accessible guide to this varied role. If you&#39;re new to the job, what exactly can you expect when you start out in a new school? If you&#39;re an old hand, what are your career development opportunities? Sections on assisting the teacher, assisting pupils and assisting the school are full of practical information, tips and strategies for new and experienced TAs. Dot Constable covers the nuts and bolts of day-to-day practice (eg: policies and procedures; SEN and support strategies; joint planning; assessment, recording and reporting; making and organising resources etc) but also addresses nitty gritty realities: how do you keep pupils on task and what do you do if relations between you and the teacher are strained? Breathe a sigh of relief, it&#39;s all here.&lt;br&gt; &quot;&quot;A concise and easily accessible resource. A must for new and experienced teaching assistants&quot; &quot;&lt;br&gt; -Anna Gibbs, Headteacher, Lancot Lower School&lt;br&gt; &quot; &quot;Clear and comprehensive ideas and advice which cover all aspects of being a TA. A super, little, usable book.&quot; &quot; -Gill Edgar, Head of KS4, Abberley Street PRU, Dudle&lt;/div&gt;" />
