      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harness the Power of Curiosity to&amp;nbsp;Foster Students&amp;rsquo; Love for Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From their youngest years, our children are innately curious. They explore the world around them through play, imagination, and discovery. They build meaning, they create understanding, and they unabashedly share their learning. It&amp;rsquo;s in this process that they find joy in life and relevance in the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why, then, do some of our students become disconnected from their learning in school? Where does this natural curiosity go? And how, as educators, can we ensure all of our students experience a meaningful and wonder-filled journey through their education?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s these questions that Trevor MacKenzie, author of the critically acclaimed book Dive into Inquiry, answers in &lt;em&gt;Inquiry Mindset&lt;/em&gt;. Co-written with kindergarten teacher Rebecca Bathurst-Hunt, &lt;em&gt;Inquiry Mindset&lt;/em&gt; offers a highly accessible journey through inquiry in the younger years. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to . . .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Empower your learners, increase engagement, and accelerate achievement.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Harness the wonderings and curiosities of your students and leverage them into powerful learning opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cultivate an inquiry mindset both as a teacher and in your students!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adopt an inquiry approach that results in the most authentic and inspiring learning you&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced!&lt;br /&gt;
