  <title>A Message to Black America - James  A Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Black America is divided into three categories. The first category consists of wealthy and famous blacks. The second category consist of the middle-class and some famous blacks as well. Then comes the third category the overwhelming number of which are inner city blacks many of whom are in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who found themselves in the latter category are the ones mentoring are intended for in this book! I firmly believed that wealthy and middle-class blacks have a duty and responsibility to come to the assistance of their fellow inner city blacks who are at a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many inner city black men are in needs of positive mentoring. These are the ones who are at a disadvantage that we addressed in the book. These are the people who are to be elevated. To be educated, given marketable skills to provide for themselves and their connections. The time has arrived for action, for steps to be implemented in order so that they may be lifted out of poverty and disrepair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Black American society should come of age, economically, socially, and politically, then, the overwhelming number of blacks at the poverty line must be brought up to par with their European Americans counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black America is losing too many young inner city black men for all sort of reasons. This cannot be allowed to continue. Therefore, we have laid out in this book of relevant information for those who desire to lift themselves up out of poverty, crime and violence, and become productive citizens!&lt;/p&gt;" />
