  <title>Ports of Call by Amin Maalouf (Book Analysis) - Bright Summaries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Unlock the more straightforward side of &lt;i&gt;Ports of Call&lt;/i&gt; with this concise and insightful summary and analysis!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This engaging summary presents an analysis of &lt;i&gt;Ports of Call&lt;/i&gt; by Amin Maalouf, a historical novel which sweeps the reader away on a journey through multiple wars, countries and eras of history. It tells the story of Ossyane, a descendant of Turkish royalty whose life is shaped by his experience of two different conflicts: becoming a member of the French Resistance in World War II leads him to meet the love of his life, only for the outbreak of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to tear them apart. By turns uplifting and heartbreaking, &lt;i&gt;Ports of Call&lt;/i&gt; is a call for tolerance, love and peace in a world scarred by war. It is the sixth novel published by Amin Maalouf, who has received the Prix Goncourt for his novel &lt;i&gt;The Rock of Tanios&lt;/i&gt; and went on to become a member of the Académie française. Although he writes in French, his native tongue is Arabic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out everything you need to know about &lt;i&gt;Ports of Call&lt;/i&gt; in a fraction of the time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;This in-depth and informative reading guide brings you:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;oA complete plot summary&lt;br&gt;oCharacter studies&lt;br&gt;oKey themes and symbols&lt;br&gt;oQuestions for further reflection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why choose BrightSummaries.com?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Available in print and digital format, our publications are designed to accompany you on your reading journey.
