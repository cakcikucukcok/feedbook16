  <title>Schooling in the Workplace - Nancy Hoffman, Stanley S. Litow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Which non-American education systems best prepare young people for fulfilling jobs and successful adult lives? And what can the United States&amp;mdash;where far too many young people currently enter adulthood without adequate preparation for the twenty-first-century job market&amp;mdash;learn, adopt, and adapt from these other systems?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; In &lt;I&gt;Schooling in the Workplace&lt;/I&gt;, Nancy Hoffman addresses these questions head on, arguing that &amp;ldquo;the smartest and quickest route to a wide variety of occupations for the majority of young people in the successful countries&amp;mdash;not a default for failing students&amp;mdash;is a vocational program that integrates work and learning.&amp;rdquo; As she notes, the programs that successfully integrate work and learning all share a fundamental commitment to helping young people find successful careers: &amp;ldquo;The purpose is not &amp;lsquo;college for all,&amp;rsquo; as in the United States today, but rather to provide the education and training young people need to prepare for a career or calling.&amp;rdquo;&lt;I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Schooling in the Workplace&lt;/I&gt; explores the vocational education programs in a wide range of countries, focusing in rich and useful detail on six in particular: Australia, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Switzerland. Framing these discussions, however, is a persistent focus on American circumstances and challenges. Far more than a survey of six &amp;ldquo;foreign&amp;rdquo; programs, this is a book prompted by and organized around the policy and practical challenges facing the United States.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
