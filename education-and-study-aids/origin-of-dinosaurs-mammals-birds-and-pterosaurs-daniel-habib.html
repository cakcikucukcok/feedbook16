  <title>Origin of Dinosaurs, Mammals, Birds and Pterosaurs - Daniel Habib</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the time when giant reptiles ruled the world, on land (dinosaurs), in the sea 
(sea monsters), and in the air (pterosaurs). It was a unique period, never to be repeated once mammals became the dominant tetrapods. Birds and mammals first appeared as well, but remained insignificant until these reptiles were already extinct.
The book is designed for a wide audience of age groups, ranging in age from seven years (my grandson Jake) to those of us at 77 (my age). The approach is holistic. For example, it describes relevant concepts within the geosciences, including how fossils record the history of life and how radioactivity provides us with the numerical ages of this history. Also, it describes the significant influence of mass extinctions and of the plate tectonic rearrangement of the continents.
The book is well-illustrated. There are more than 65 accurate drawings and additional cartoons.They are used to illuminate the written narrative. 
Enjoy." />
