  <title>Discover Yourself, Discover Happiness - Eva Stanová</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is my personal story, my journey through life. I am writing it despite what I read somewhere that its not good to write about oneself. But how can I write about things I havent experienced firsthand? The most difficult thing that has happened to me in my lifedivorcealso brought about the best things. I discovered my own lifestylethe happiness lifestyle.
Maybe all that is needed is a change of viewpoint and an understanding that if two people are not headed in the same direction, it might be time to part ways. Peacefully, lovingly, and with nothing but the best wishes for the other person.
I am writing this story for those who are looking for happiness, searching for it themselves, or those trying to deal with their relationships. I am also writing it for myself. I am closing a chapter of my life, and I am assessing its worth. I will write about my experiences, wins and losses, and maybe through them you will realize what you want and dont want in your life and those things that influence us in life. Sometimes it can be some small thing, and sometimes something more serious, that will be reflected in our subconscious. This negative information about ourselves then influences us on our journey through life and will trap us in certain models of behavior. My story is about searching for my own path. Despite being divorced, I am fully supportive of the family life, and that it is an arena of freedom. What do you think gives us freedom?
For me personally, it is being able to speak the truth and have open communication. Thanks to these two things I am able to grow, and the same goes for the people that I am communicating with. We give each other an opportunity for change. If we are not communicating openly and are keeping our emotional wounds to ourselves, maybe we are destroying a prospective relationship. Yes, I know, you need two to tango. Where is the best place to start? With yourself. No one will teach you how to live a happy life. We learn from our parents. Without even knowing it, they are showing and teaching us models of behavior, whether they are negative or positive. But as children, were not able to recognize what these are, and we accept everything that we see and also what we feel.
In January 2005, I laid hands on Virginia Satirs book Conjoint Family Therapy. As early as 1970, Virginia Satir was describing how we could live freely within our families. Yes, we could, if we knew how to communicate truthfully and openly, without fear, without anger, and without hurt.
My divorce mobilized all the inner power and skills I had that I was unaware of until then. It was a valuable part of my journey of finding myself! This path began sometime during this period. In the two years leading to my divorce, I felt as if I was buried alive. Do you know that feeling?
We can all decide whether we want to live again and cherish every minute of life. I decided that I did.
This book is comprised of three parts: part 1 is my very own story; part 2 talks about ways and methods that have helped me; part 3 allows space for creation of a happy life. It is an interactive e-book, so whichever way you choose, you will always find something new. After clicking on the green words, you will find more information on the topic. You can enter all your additional inquiries into Google.
Dont believe a word I say. Let the book inspire you. Examine and discover your lifestylethe happiness lifestyle." />
