  <title>Barack Hussein Obama ….Few Are Chosen - Sam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Barack Hussein ObamaFew Are Chosen.The Obamanating Spirit and Remembered Stories is an inspired book written about Barack Hussein Obama, President of the United States of America.   The book consists of several topics that I hope the reader will find enlightening.   It is a look backwards, in that I tell the audience about the segregated South and a look forward, the place where we must strive to be.  Nevertheless, I hope that each individual will enjoy reading my book, which incorporates biography, humor, historical facts, scripture, and religious beliefs.  It is not an attack on anyone or any group.  It is intended to be an eye-opener in that it deals with several topics that relate to the President including birth, patriotism and religion. &lt;br&gt;
   Each chapter discusses what I believe is an American peoples concern.      Some people might see my book as a book on race relations and to some degree it is, but gently.  &lt;br&gt;
There are thirteen chapters.  In Chapter Five I discuss the forty year prophesy of the coming of Barack Obama;  while in Chapter Seven I discuss the struggles of African Americans then and now, the African American churches, including Rev. Wright, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King (among other things);  Chapter Nine, Forcing Scared Against The President  discusses how the politicians work overtime to portray President Obama illegitimately to the American Public, and Chapter Ten, disputes the assertion that Barack Obama is a radical (Really?); Chapter Eleven, Will the Real Mr. Speaker Stand, questions the heart of John Boehner and  Chapter Twelve, Guess Whos Coming To The Tea Party  warns the Tea Party that they could very easily become the terror group of the past. &lt;br&gt;
  Chapter One, I Saw An Angel is the foundation for the book and how it all got started. &lt;br&gt;" />
