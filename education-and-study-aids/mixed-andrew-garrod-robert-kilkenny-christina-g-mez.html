      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mixed&lt;/em&gt; presents engaging and incisive first-person experiences of what it is like to be multiracial in what is supposedly a postracial world. Bringing together twelve essays by college students who identify themselves as multiracial, this book considers what this identity means in a reality that occasionally resembles the post-racial dream of some and at other times recalls a familiar world of racial and ethnic prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring a wide range of concerns and anxieties, aspirations and ambitions, these young writers, who all attended Dartmouth College, come from a variety of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Unlike individuals who define themselves as having one racial identity, these students have lived the complexity of their identity from a very young age. In &lt;em&gt;Mixed&lt;/em&gt;, a book that will benefit educators, students, and their families, they eloquently and often passionately reveal how they experience their multiracial identity, how their parents&#39; race or ethnicity shaped their childhoods, and how perceptions of their race have affected their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
