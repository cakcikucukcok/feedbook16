  <title>Tonic for Great Life - Kiran Kurwade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tonic for Great Life&lt;/em&gt; is a quest for the best, a quest that can make us more positive, purposeful, and peaceful. A leap to holistic, harmonious, and happy life, TONIC is an acronym for truth overcomes negatively influenced conditions. Amid worldly chaos, there is hardly anyone alive who doesnt want to (1) love and be loved, (2) grow infinitely (e.g., become a businessperson who wants to scale up endlessly), and (3) live as long as possible because there is something in us that is pure love, infinite and eternal. The author has well bridged the principles and practicalities of day-to-day life as such that anybody can easily understand, enjoy reading, and aspire for a great life. The book has easy analogies, relevant examples, and self-conceived two-liners by the author that will make you smile; and you will be tempted to share the insights (tonic) with your dear ones via SMS or FB. Knowing your great gift (strength) and how to create great self for great purpose, how to be holistically intelligent, strengthen great relationship, and lead by great example are honest attempts of the author. You can be an employee or entrepreneur, a student or teacheryou can be a great change-maker.&lt;/p&gt;" />
