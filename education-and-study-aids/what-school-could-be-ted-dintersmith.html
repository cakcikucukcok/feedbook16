  <title>What School Could Be - Ted Dintersmith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An inspiring account of ordinary teachers who are doing extraordinary things that could transform education&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What School Could Be &lt;/i&gt;offers an inspiring vision of what our teachers and students can accomplish if trusted with the challenge of developing the skills and ways of thinking needed to thrive in a world of dizzying technological change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation expert Ted Dintersmith took an unprecedented trip across America, visiting all fifty states in a single school year. He originally set out to raise awareness about the urgent need to reimagine education to prepare students for a world marked by innovation--but America&#39;s teachers one-upped him. All across the country, he met teachers in ordinary settings doing extraordinary things, creating innovative classrooms where children learn deeply and joyously as they gain purpose, agency, essential skillsets and mindsets, and real knowledge. Together, these new ways of teaching and learning offer a vision of what school could be&amp;#8212;and a model for transforming schools throughout the United States and beyond. Better yet, teachers and parents don&#39;t have to wait for the revolution to come from above. They can readily implement small changes that can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America&#39;s clock is ticking. Our archaic model of education trains our kids for a world that no longer exists, and accelerating advances in technology are eliminating millions of jobs. But the trailblazing of many American educators gives us reasons for hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capturing bold ideas from teachers and classrooms across America, &lt;i&gt;What School Could Be&lt;/i&gt; provides a realistic and profoundly optimistic roadmap for creating cultures of innovation and real learning in all our schools.&lt;/p&gt;" />
