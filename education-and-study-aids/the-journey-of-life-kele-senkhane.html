As life proceeds, I grow to understand and see that success is a broad term and has a varied definition from one person to the other. The books primary focus is on how life events transpire regardless of my plans, the significant philosophies and influences I have accumulated and learned in my journey as young woman. In the period of my pursuits to achieve, I get to realise lifes astonishing outcome. That life does not always go according to plan and the significance of remaining optimistic and not forfeiting in challenging times. It also touches on moral values and principles I have been taught growing up. I scale  personal beliefs with societys beliefs and expectations on the meaning and measures of success to an average eye of the youth. In addition to the concept, I want to contribute to the youth society and older society an optional way of perception and thinking. I want to inspire and encourage people to believe in their dreams and be objective oriented, regardless of the obstacles encountered. Be able to give people awareness to appreciate simple things in life, although you and we are pursuing our dreams and objectives. Understand the true meaning of success, though definition of success varies from each person. It may be spiritual, financial, material, or psychological success).
