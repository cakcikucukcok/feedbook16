  <title>Acing the Undergrad - Emeka V. Anazia, Carrie V. Anazia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;Take a deep breath. You are entering one of the most exciting, challenging, and important chapters of your life. What you do during your years of college will directly impact your future. You have the responsibility and power to shape your destiny. Many people unfortunately dont realize this until it is too late, and inevitably waste their college experience. So what do you do now? How do you make the most out of your experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where &lt;em&gt;Acing The Undergrad: Your Personal Mentor&lt;/em&gt; comes into play. Emeka and Carrie Anazia both graduated from college Summa Cum Laude, were heavily involved with extracurricular activities (including holding leadership positions and mentorship roles), and worked part time jobs, while thoroughly enjoying every moment of their college lives. In this book, Emeka and Carrie will be your personal mentors to guide you through your journey. &lt;em&gt;Acing The Undergrad: Your Personal Mentor&lt;/em&gt; is based on ten specific skills, or college fundamentals, that must be mastered in order to become a successful college student. These college fundamentals address areas such as managing your time, classroom etiquette, and expanding your network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, Emeka and Carrie supplement the fundamentals by specifying personal examples of how they both came to mastering each of those skills, and how mastering them greatly impacted their college lives. Also provided are practical tips on how to apply each of those ten skills to your college experience to help you achieve excellence and reach your full potential. If you follow them consistently, you will accomplish your goals, get the most out of college, and ultimately ACE the undergrad!&lt;/p&gt;
