  <title>Case Studies by Kmc Class of ’64 - Kanakadurga R. Poduri Md Faapmr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a compilation of case studies contributed by the members of the class of 1964 from different specialties. 
Dr. Kanakadurga R. Poduri, Professor &amp; Chair of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&amp;R) at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, New York, USA and a member of the 1964 class of KMC has edited a volume rich with clinical insights about highly complex patients. The authors, all members of the same medical school class, have accumulated a vast collection of clinical experiences and expertise that they share with the reader in a precise and passionate way. Readers are not only exposed to rare conditions that present in other settings of the world, but also expand medical knowledge based on clinical data. Every contributor to this volume should not only be congratulated on celebrating their 50th anniversary, but also on their contributions to improving patient care and the rare insights they have shared with fellow physicians and interested readers. Dr. Poduris compilation of the case presentations is exemplary.

The case studies presented in this multi-authored book both stimulate and challenge students and practicing physicians to think broadly and creatively about achieving the best outcomes in patient care.  It is frequently true that the most difficult situations and puzzling diagnostic dilemmas provide insight into better ways to treat the common cases.  Dr. Kanakadurga. Rao Poduri has brought together a unique resource for those who wish to expand their clinical capabilities and to improve the lives of their patients.
