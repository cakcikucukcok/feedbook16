Completing a doctoral program is not easy, and trying to complete a dissertation at the end of your program when the last of your energy and motivation is hanging by a string, can seem insurmountable. So, yes, it would be easier to quit. There are even individuals out in the world who proudly use the acronym ABD (all-but-dissertation) as their terminal degree on resumes, business cards and such. But in all honesty, I can tell you what ABD really stands forquitting. Youve invested too much time, energy and money into your doctoral experience to give up.
