  <title>Learn to Read from Sounds - Florence Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;To &lt;b&gt;Learn to Read from Sounds&lt;/b&gt;, author Florence Barnes shows how either adults or children can easily be taught to read, a vital ability. Without it, covers of books become closed doors on worlds that we would otherwise never know.
&lt;P&gt;
With the use of phonics, the author shows just how easy it can be to learn to read. The student learns by sounding the vowels in combination with the consonants. Then he or she goes on to build words, brick by brick.
&lt;P&gt;
The book provides many examples of short and long vowel sounds. After that come the other vowel combinations. All these elements are used in building longer words.
&lt;P&gt;
After the student has finished with this book, reading will no longer be a puzzle, or even very difficult. With practice, it will become easy. Companion audio-cassette tapes included with book." />
