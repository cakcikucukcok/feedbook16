  <title>A Fly in a Bottle. Or, if Only I Knew it Before.: SHORT STORY # 33.  Nonfiction series #1 - # 60. - Alla P. Gakuba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I undertook a major change in my life&amp;mdash;and filed for a divorce. Shortly I was swamped with numerous difficulties and faced many types of people that some I never dealt before. Lawyers, courts, judges, contractors and subcontractors (I start remodeling our 20-years old house to put it for sale), real estate agents, accountants, financial advisors, experts, etc. It seems that everyone took advantage of my vulnerability and dependence on them. They assumed that I am stupid and commanded unreasonable amount of money for their not so good services.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That is: soon I found as if I was swimming in a river, full of crocodiles.&amp;nbsp; What did I do? How did I reached the shore alive and in a good spirit?&amp;nbsp; Please learned my skills and strategies in this story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
