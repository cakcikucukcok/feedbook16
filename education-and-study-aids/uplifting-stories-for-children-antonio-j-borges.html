      <meta name="description" content="&lt;H4&gt;&#39;Jessica&#39; is the story of a poor widow and her bedridden seven-year-old daughter, who learn miracles come true in the hands of God. &lt;P&gt;
I hope you will enjoy reading both stories, &#39;Chew Chung the Mouse&#39; and the &#39;Christmas Crickets.&#39; &#39;Chew Chung the Mouse&#39; was written to help children face any obstacles that may come their way in life. May it be sports or math and English, if they stick to it they will succeed. And the story can teach little boys that if they admire a little girl, they shouldn&#39;t throw pebbles and rocks, they should throw flowers. &lt;P&gt;
The &#39;Christmas Crickets&#39; was written to teach children to be compassionate to those who are less fortunate in the world, to treat them with love and kindness and to maybe give a poor child a toy that they may not have any use for anymore in this special time of giving." />
