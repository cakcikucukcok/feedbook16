So many students spend too much time learning how to take notes, prepare for class, case brief, outline, prepare for finals and so much more. No one will teach them these things yet mastery of these things is pivotal to the student&amp;#39;s success in law school. This causes the student stress, leads to being unproductive, and it can create an unbalanced lifestyle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Law School in Plain English is the solution to these problems. With its uncompromising plainness and easy to read style, the book covers all aspects of what it means to be a law student, how to succeed, and how to improve quality of life while in law school." />
