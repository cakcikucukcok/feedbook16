  <title>Three Minus One: Stories of Parents&#39; Love and Loss - Sean Hanish, Brooke Warner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three Minus One: Parents&#39; Stories of Love and Loss is a collection of intimate, soul-baring stories and artwork by parents who have lost a child to stillbirth, miscarriage, or neonatal death, inspired by the film Return to Zero.  The loss of a child is unlike any other, and the impact that it has on the mother, the father, their family, and their friends is devastating-a shockwave of pain and guilt that spreads through their entire community. But the majority of those affected, especially mothers, often suffer their pain in silence, convinced that their grief and trauma is theirs to bear alone. This anthology of raw memoirs, heartbreaking stories, truthful poems, beautiful painting, and stunning photography from the parents who have suffered child loss offers insight into this unique, devastating and life-changing experience-breaking the silence and offering a ray of hope to the many parents out there in search of answers, understanding, and healing." />
