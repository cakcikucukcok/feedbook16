  <title>The Ministry of Utmost Happiness Parody - Darundhati Roy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I came to know that most of my fan&#39;s brains got fried after reading my novels &quot;The God of Dirty Things: Bicker Prize Winner 2017&quot;, &quot;Things That Can and Cannot be Screwed&quot;, &quot;Broken Banana&quot;, &quot;The Hanging Of Faizal Guru&quot;, &quot;The Shape of The Breast&quot;, etc. My fans are no longer able to live with religious Hindus peacefully. They are getting offended at anything remotely related to Hindu religion. This is hampering my fan&#39;s physical and mental health. Unfortunately it is neither possible to avoid 80 crore Hindus, nor can we deport them to Andaman Islands. Hence I wrote this novel to help my fans get &quot;reverse brainwash&quot;. After reading this book, my fans may start treating Hindus as human beings. I would also like to apologize to all my fans for my past misdeeds. Jai Hind." />
