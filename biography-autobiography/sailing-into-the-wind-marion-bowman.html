&lt;P&gt;MARION BOWMAN was born in Belize, spent her childhood sailing on the sea, and then relocated to the busy city of New Orleans, Louisiana. After college, she trod a path toward marriage and motherhood, just the same as other young women of the 1950&#39;s.

&lt;P&gt;SAILING INTO THE WIND: A MEMOIR OF LIFE LESSONS examines the struggle of seeking one&#39;s own identity beyond the labels of wife and mother. Is it okay to want more? Through raw honesty, Marion reflects on what it means to be a woman and how she discovered the biggest adventure of her life. Ponder this deep question about your own journey as you read along.&lt;/P&gt;" />
