  <title>Color Expressions - Dr. Lonnie G. Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many educational institutions headed by women dont get the credit they deserve. I think that the missing critical argument for the value of these women is not being recognized or even revered. Thinking about those women today and in history, their stories seem so insignificant to men and their accomplishments! Also, Ive taught Sunday school for years at several different churches. When creating lesson plans, Ive found that many of the stories being taught to the children were male-orientated. As I searched for diversity (men and women teachings), it was frustrating to me! Even in the Bible, the women stories seem to be short on expressing the roles they played in several enormous and crucial events, making them the catalysts that shaped and defined those events." />
