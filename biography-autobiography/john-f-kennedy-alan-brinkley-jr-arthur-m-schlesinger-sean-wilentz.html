  <title>John F. Kennedy - Alan Brinkley, Jr. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sean Wilentz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The young president who brought vigor and glamour to the White House while he confronted cold war crises abroad and calls for social change at home&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Fitzgerald Kennedy was a new kind of president. He redefined how Americans came to see the nation&#39;s chief executive. He was forty-three when he was inaugurated in 1961--the youngest man ever elected to the office--and he personified what he called the &quot;New Frontier&quot; as the United States entered the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Alan Brinkley shows in this incisive and lively assessment, the reality of Kennedy&#39;s achievements was much more complex than the legend. His brief presidency encountered significant failures--among them the Bay of Pigs fiasco, which cast its shadow on nearly every national-security decision that followed. But Kennedy also had successes, among them the Cuban Missile Crisis and his belated but powerful stand against segregation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy seemed to live on a knife&#39;s edge, moving from one crisis to another--Cuba, Laos, Berlin, Vietnam, Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. His controversial public life mirrored his hidden private life. He took risks that would seem reckless and even foolhardy when they emerged from secrecy years later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy&#39;s life, and his violent and sudden death, reshaped our view of the presidency. Brinkley gives us a full picture of the man, his times, and his enduring legacy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
