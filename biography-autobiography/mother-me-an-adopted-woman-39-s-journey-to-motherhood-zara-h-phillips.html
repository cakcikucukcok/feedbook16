  <title>Mother Me: An Adopted Woman&#39;s Journey to Motherhood - Zara H Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The adopted daughter of loving parents, Zara Phillips felt out of place since childhood. Although cherished, she grew up insecure and alone, consumed by a void she found impossible to fill. Isolation led to alienation, until her talent brought her to the center of the heady London rock &#39;n&#39; roll scene of the 1980s. Zara became lost in a downward spiral of drugs, alcohol and destructive relationships. An intense search for the truth of her birth led to an awakening and to recovery. Zara&#39;s activism for adoptee rights springs from a very personal passion. In the end, it was Zara&#39;s experience of becoming a mother that revealed what being adopted really meant. For the first time, she gained deep understanding and compassion for both her birth mother and her adoptive mother and was able to start the healing process. Mother Me bravely illuminates the lifelong impact of adoption on every member of the adoption triad-adoptee, birth mother and adoptive mother-as well as the families of each." />
