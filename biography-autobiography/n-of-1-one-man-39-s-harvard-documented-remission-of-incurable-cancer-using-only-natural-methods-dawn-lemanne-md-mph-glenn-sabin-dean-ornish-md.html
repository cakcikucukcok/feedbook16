  <title>n of 1: One man&#39;s Harvard-documented remission of incurable cancer using only natural methods - Dawn Lemanne Md Mph, Glenn Sabin, Dean Ornish Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years ago my doctors had no cure for my cancer. So I went on a quest to find my own treatment. This is my story...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1991, Glenn Sabin was a 28-year-old newlywed diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)&amp;ndash;a disease doctors called &amp;ldquo;uniformly fatal.&amp;rdquo; Treatments could buy him some time and eventually ease his discomfort, but there was no conventional cure. Glenn&amp;rsquo;s prognosis was clear: he was going to die.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although Glenn and his wife, Linda, continued to consult with doctors, cancer specialists and top oncologists, Glenn made a monumental decision: he would become his own health advocate. While he continued to &amp;ldquo;watch and wait,&amp;rdquo; Glenn would figure out how to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No one could predict when a large-scale clinical trial would discover a cure for CLL, so Glenn began his own, medically monitored and carefully researched lifestyle changes. He would conduct his own, single patient clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He would become an &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;n of 1&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, Glenn is not only alive, but a 2012 biopsy at Harvard confirmed that his bone marrow contains no leukemic cells. His case is now &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.glennsabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Glenn_Sabin_Cureus_case_report.pdf&quot;&gt;part of the medical literature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;n of 1&lt;/em&gt;, author Glenn Sabin takes readers along his remarkable journey with &amp;lsquo;incurable&amp;rsquo; cancer, where he discovers:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;No two cancers are exactly alike. Our bodies, minds and diseases are unique, and need to be treated as such.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Knowledge and empowerment are your best allies against a life-limiting diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle changes are a powerful way to help prevent, manage and reduce the recurrence of disease&amp;mdash;and to improve your quality of life.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;A strong support system and a clear mind may significantly improve your health.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;" />
