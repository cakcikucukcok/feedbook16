  <title>How Self-Love Woke the Mama Bear: Opening a Gift After Nineteen Years - Melanie J. Police</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When you devote your life to raising two children and teaching hundreds of students, you dish out a lot of love. You give unselfishly. It feels good, albeit stressful, but you wouldn&#39;t trade it for the world. There isn&#39;t anything you wouldn&#39;t do for these children, these adolescents, these young adults. Their joy is your joy.  And after 19 years, you feel happy. Why wouldn&#39;t you? You are making a difference in the lives of so many.  Then one day you realize that while you have been busy shaping the lives of so many, you&#39;ve only been dreaming of the life you really want. It&#39;s not until that day, when something unexpected happens, when you find you&#39;ve been living an amazing story all along, when you find self-love, that you really wake up and start living.  A collection of short stories, journal entries, tributes to teachers, poems, and blog posts; the lessons on these pages come from children, students, and teachers I&#39;ve had the opportunity to know, teach, learn from, and love." />
