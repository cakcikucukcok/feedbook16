  <title>In the Shadow of Angels - Charles Maldon Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his book &lt;i&gt;In the Shadow of Angels,&lt;/i&gt;, Charles Maldon reflects upon that season of his life when he was without the peace of God. He presents the contribution of several extraordinary saints whom he addresses as angels who are largely responsible for his journey and victory into the perfect peace of God. He reveals the uniqueness of each angel and relates the love and care provided by each when he needed someone to encourage and stand by him on his march toward his purpose and calling in God.&lt;p&gt;
These individuals displayed strength and character that became an incentive for him to strive to be the best person that God ordained
him to be. Without them being there, his life in the Deep South would almost definitely have taken a different direction. By the mercy of
God, he encountered each of them at a time when he was in desperate need of love and encouragement to keep from fainting. Each of them left him with a lifetime memory and a victory of healing and peace and thankfulness." />
