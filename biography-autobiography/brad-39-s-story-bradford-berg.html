  <title>Brad&#39;s Story - Bradford Berg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brad&#39;s Story describes the life of Bradford Berg, who grew up in Florida. Introduced to the sky at the age of seven by a flight on a Ford Tri-Motor, he fell in love with flying. Nine years later, he earned his pilot&#39;s license. Before he could vote, Brad won the wings of an Air Force pilot. He tells of peacetime and wartime experiences on assignments in Okinawa and Korea.
After the Air Force, he joined Trans World Airlines and rose to chief pilot, responsible for the Western Division. During that period, he flew in the United States, Europe and the Middle East.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When not at the controls of a 747, he was often flying one of his own planes or a glider over the deserts of California. With wife, Nell, they took motor home vacations, raced greyhound dogs and pursued a passion for golf.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At fourteen, Brad lighted a cigarette and eventually became a three-pack-a-day smoker. Warned of the risks, he responded, &quot;it can&#39;t happen to me&#39;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Brad confesses to his despair at learning he had lung cancer. He describes the medical treatment. He recounts how he tried every treatment known to man, but failed to break his addiction. Then he found one that worked and he suggests that others try it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After having part of a lung removed, Brad struggled to put his feelings on paper. Then a follow-up, medical scan revealed the cancer was back. Few people are willing to share these intimate experiences. Brad does." />
