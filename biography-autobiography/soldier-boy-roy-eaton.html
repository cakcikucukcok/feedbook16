  <title>Soldier Boy - Roy Eaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I thoroughly enjoyed reading Roy&amp;rsquo;s Soldier Boy. He brings back many memories of The New York Military Academy, and has done a fine job. Roy was always a winner, and nothing has changed.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;- Donald J. Trump&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plucked from the comfortable and familiar surroundings of his close-knit family and community, the author, Roy Eaton, at the age of eight, reluctantly embarks on a journey of discovery that, at times, will place him in conflict with his peers, his loved ones, and, himself. Cast into a world where one&amp;rsquo;s existence is determined by the survival of the fittest, and one in which success often promulgates failure, Eaton struggles to overcome his insecurities and the discouraging profiling of others as he attempts to find himself and identify his purpose in life. Soldier Boy is a story of perseverance, of overcoming disappointment and failure, of defying the misuse of authority, of rectifying injustice, and of coming of age. Eaton&amp;rsquo;s journey is a testament to the drive to succeed that exists in each of us, and to those whom have made our passage through life a memorable and rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Roy Eaton, a graduate of New York Military Academy, earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Pennsylvania Military College, an M.A.T. from Connecticut College, and a commission in the U.S. Army Reserve Officer Corps. Roy taught mathematics and wrestling at St. Bernard High School in Uncasville, Connecticut, and was recently inducted into their Athletic Hall of Fame. He has been included in the publication &amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s Who Among America&amp;rsquo;s Teachers,&amp;rdquo; and was elected by his faculty to the school&amp;rsquo;s Board of Trustees. He was selected as the first team coach by the Connecticut Freestyle Wrestling Federation, and his high school team has been cited by the state&amp;rsquo;s Governor and Legislature for their outstanding performance. Roy retired in 1996, and currently resides with his wife Debra in Naples, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;" />
