  <title>Where Have I Been All My Life?: A Journey Toward Love and Wholeness - Cheryl Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where Have I Been All My Life? is a compelling memoir recounting one woman&#39;s journey through grief and a profound feeling of unworthiness to wholeness and healing. It begins with the chillingly sudden death of Rice&#39;s mother, and is followed by her foray into the center of mourning. With wisdom, grace, and humor, Rice recounts the grief games she plays in an effort to resurrect her mother; her efforts to get her therapist, who she falls desperately in love with, to run away with her; and the transformation of her husband from fantasy man to ordinary guy to superhero. In the process, she experiences aching revelations about her family and her past-and realizes what she must leave behind, and what she can carry forward with her." />
