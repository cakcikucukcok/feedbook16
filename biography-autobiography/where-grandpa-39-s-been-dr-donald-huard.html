  <title>Where Grandpa&#39;s Been... - Dr. Donald Huard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a 115 lb. teenager drafted into the United States Army during the Korean conflict, Donald Huard was laughed at, taunted and bullied by other recruits. He met his military responsibilities effectively, however, facing the potential for a military court martial during one tour of duty before his honorable discharge in 1954. His is an interesting soldier&#39;s story.
Determined to get a college education, Don used his G I Bill to get his associate&#39;s and bachelor&#39;s degrees. Then, with the firm support of his wife and four children over a very long period of seventeen years he managed to meet the requirements for his master&#39;s and Ph.D. degrees in psychology with minors in criminology and business. His is a very successful story of constructive determination. 
How does one recover at the age of 50 as the loving father of four teenagers grieving the loss of their mother? How does he rebuild his own life following such sadness? Eventually, Don met and married Margie, the wonderful lady who enabled him to live again. Theirs is an interesting story of true love. 
In his early eighties now, Dr. Huard tells his story in this, his own personal autobiography, written slowly over the last 25 years." />
