  <title>Illusion of Justice - Jerome F. Buting</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interweaving his account of the Steven Avery trial at the heart of &lt;em&gt;Making a Murderer&lt;/em&gt; with other high profile cases from his criminal defense career, attorney Jerome F. Buting explains the flaws in America&amp;#8217;s criminal justice system and lays out a provocative, persuasive blue-print for reform.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over his career, Jerome F. Buting has spent hundreds of hours in courtrooms representing defendants in criminal trials. When he agreed to join Dean Strang as co-counsel for the defense in &lt;em&gt;Steven A. Avery vs. State of Wisconsin&lt;/em&gt;, he knew a tough fight lay ahead. But, as he reveals in &lt;em&gt;Illusion of Justice&lt;/em&gt;, no-one could have predicted just how tough and twisted that fight would be&amp;#8212;or that it would become the center of the documentary &lt;em&gt;Making a Murderer&lt;/em&gt;, which made Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey household names and thrust Buting into the spotlight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buting&amp;#8217;s powerful, riveting boots-on-the-ground narrative of Avery&amp;#8217;s and Dassey&amp;#8217;s cases becomes a springboard to examine the shaky integrity of law enforcement and justice in the United States, which Buting has witnessed firsthand for more than 35 years. From his early career as a public defender to his success overturning wrongful convictions working with the Innocence Project, his story provides a compelling expert view into the high-stakes arena of criminal defense law; the difficulties of forensic science; and a horrifying reality of biased interrogations, coerced or false confessions, faulty eyewitness testimony, official misconduct, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining narrative reportage with critical commentary and personal reflection, Buting explores his professional and personal motivations, career-defining cases&amp;#8212;including his shocking fifteen-year-long fight to clear the name of another man wrongly accused and convicted of murder&amp;#8212;and what must happen if our broken system is to be saved. Taking a place beside &lt;em&gt;Just Mercy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The New Jim Crow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Illusion of Justice&lt;/em&gt; is a tour-de-force from a relentless and eloquent advocate for justice who is determined to fulfill his professional responsibility and, in the face of overwhelming odds, make America&amp;#8217;s judicial system work as it is designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
