      <meta name="description" content="Careers and life can have many twists and turns. The external environment constantly changes and these changes are beyond the control of most of us. Sometimes we have to alter our careers and our goals in order to survive. Change, however, creates opportunities and we must prepare ourselves to be ready to seize opportunities that come our way.&lt;p&gt;

He grew up and played street football with Bart Starr. He volunteered for surgical service in Vietnam. And he was a doctor in the ER when four little girls, victims of the horrible church bombing, were brought in. He has experienced all of these events and more in his fascinating life in addition to making important changes in his careers throughout his life.  He believes that to survive and thrive in life, it is imperative to differentiate yourself to be competitive in todays challenging marketplace. In &lt;i&gt;Coping Successfully with Changing Tides and Winds&lt;/i&gt;, Kushner offers practical advice to anyone facing job loss or changes." />
