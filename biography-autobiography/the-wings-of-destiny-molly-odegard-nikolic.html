  <title>The Wings of Destiny - Molly Odegard Nikolic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being a professional actress is not an easy career, but when youve been bitten by the acting bug, youre doomed. Why do I say doomed? Because it can take away so much of what normal life is about. Im talking about the ordinary things in life, like a stable married life with children and a home. I dont know if I was born with the acting bug or if it came later to me, but it certainly ruled the first part of my life. I look at the world of theater and filmoh, I guess they say movies nowand I see the same thing happening. Whats it all for? Its for fame and money, thats what. Its a purely selfish endeavor. In my early days, they hadnt discovered the idea of genetic forces leading people into things unknown. I do understand that Freud played with this field, but regular people didnt know about it. We all just did what we did. Often, people are looked at because of preconceived notions or what was an established family tradition. You swam alone, going into uncharted waters of your own desire and making. Well, thats what I did. Am I sorry? Partially. I left my first husband for it, and I gave up my one and only child." />
