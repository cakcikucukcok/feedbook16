  <title>Alva and Gunnar Myrdal - Thomas Etzemüller, Alex Skinner</title>

The Myrdals successfully established their own &amp;quot;modern American&amp;quot; marriage as a media image and role model for reform. Far from perfect, their marriage was disrupted by numerous conflicts, mirrored in thousands of private letters.
