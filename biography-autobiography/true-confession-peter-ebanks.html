  <title>True Confession - Peter Ebanks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Peter Ebanks was a guy who grew up with his heart desiring on becoming wealthy someday. He started out working in the electrical field and hoped that this trade would someday see his dreams come true. 
He got himself involved with the sales of cocaine because of bad friendsdoing this on the side to make extra money.
He left the electrical field at an early age and vented into the clothing business, hoping to get a breakthrough.
Neither the electrical field, the clothing store, nor the sale of drugs was able to make a change to bring Peter closer to becoming wealthy, till eventually Peter ended up in prison from being caught with cocaine. It was where he became diagnosed as being schizophrenic because he was unable to cope with prison life.
He was later released from prison and got a job as an electrical inspector, where he later decided to abstract electricity from the power company and was caught and barely missed going to prison a second time as he was given a suspended sentence.
Now Peter is presently employed with an electrical company and he is in the process of seeking a loan from an institution to pay off the back fees that he owes the power company." />
