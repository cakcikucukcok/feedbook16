  <title>Beating Goliath - Art Briles, Don Yaeger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Rule, Texas, Art Briles learned at a young age the importance of hard work and faith from his parents. Soon that faith would be tested. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On their way to see him play in a college football game, Briles&#39; parents and aunt died in a car crash. This event shaped Briles into the man he is today. His father, Dennis, left him with a series of lessons. He taught his son that the world doesn&#39;t just hand you things, you have to earn them. And he taught him the influence that faith could have in his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Briles put these lessons to work as a football coach, where he established his reputation for turning struggling teams into winners, from high school to the staff at Texas Tech to head coach at the University of Houston. Hired to coach Baylor in 2007, he was faced with a familiar task. Within three years, Briles led the Bears to their first bowl game in 15 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, he instills those same lessons into his young players, helping them find a reason to excel. There are plenty of excuses for failure but Briles surrounds himself with people who are fearless when it comes to chasing success. That is one of the many lessons he imparts to his readers, with chapters that include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* God and the Teaching of Dennis Briles&lt;br&gt;* Finding Your Passion&lt;br&gt;* You Can Change Attitude, Not Talent&lt;br&gt;* Passing in the Land of Earl Campbell&lt;br&gt;* Everybody is a Captain&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filled with dramatic football stories and lessons learned, this book will inspire and entertain.&lt;/p&gt;" />
