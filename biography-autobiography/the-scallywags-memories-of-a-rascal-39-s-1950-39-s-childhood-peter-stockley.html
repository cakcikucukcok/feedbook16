  <title>The Scallywags - Memories of a Rascal&#39;s 1950&#39;s Childhood - Peter Stockley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you ever think about how the roads you walked as a child change the doors that open in your future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1951, seven-year-old Peter Stockley&#39;s life was set down a dark path after losing his mother. Her legacy to him was an optimism and spirit that even a vile step-mother could not break, and after an explosive confrontation, Peter set off on a new journey, via an orphanage, to his aunt and uncle&#39;s home in a tenement block by the North Liverpool docks: The Billogs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was here he became one of &#39;The Scallywags&#39;, a group of streetwise young rascals who knew every inch of the canals, docklands and railway lines. With a turbulent home life, intense family tragedy and a chronic heart murmur, Peter had ground to make up in a golden age when children would play in the streets from dusk until dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the Scallywags, he had the run of the city. Peter embarked on a youth of picaresque adventures; clinging to the backs of speeding lorries, treading the boards of bombed houses for firewood, head-spinning climbs up fivestorey block of flats – nothing was out of bounds for the Scallywags. But their adventures also gave him an iron-clad sense of morality, honesty and respect which would go on to shape the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nostalgic, deeply moving – and often extremely funny – memoir of youth and young manhood in the Liverpool of the fifties and sixties recalls the exuberant joy every child feels at being &#39;one of the gang&#39;, and explores how the future can play out in very unexpected ways. &lt;/p&gt;" />
