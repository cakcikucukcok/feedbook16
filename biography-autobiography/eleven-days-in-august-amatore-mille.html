  <title>Eleven Days in August - Amatore Mille</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A funny, poignant memoir of the author&#39;s annual eleven day transition from Wall Street to his family&#39;s Italian sausage business at the Wisconsin State Fair. A return to family, hometown...and self.  Great Americana! 
&lt;p&gt;
Welcome to the August lives of Amatore Mille and his family.  The year is 2001...and 1957...and 1973 - actually, every year, since 1932 - when the Milles began an August summer tradition of selling Italian sausage sandwiches at The Wisconsin State Fair.  You are about to enter a world where Italian immigrant grandparents leave their indelible mark on three subsequent generations, where a father, in his inimitable way, focuses on the family business...and his family...for eleven days of each summer, and where children grow up with sawdust underfoot and State Fair attractions all around.
&lt;p&gt;
In episodes that move between present and past, the author takes you on a tour of family escapades that, in turn, are laugh-out-loud funny...and touching...where grandma, with no experience, is forced to drive expensive cars, grandpa provides light-hearted amusement (but little work), and the author, through misadventures and near-tragedy, finally learns what the family business is really all about." />
