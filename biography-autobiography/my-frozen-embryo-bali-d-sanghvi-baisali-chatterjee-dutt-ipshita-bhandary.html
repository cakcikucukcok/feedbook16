  <title>My Frozen Embryo - Bali D. Sanghvi, Baisali Chatterjee Dutt, Ipshita Bhandary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What do you do when you want to be a mother more than anything in this worldbut your body betrays you?  Do you leave it to the forces of nature and prayer? Do you cling to wisps of hope? Or do you wait for a miracle?
Sometimes, you have to work towards the miracle and that means seeking help.
My Frozen Embryo chronicles the story of my empty womb, my struggle, my acceptance if being tagged as a woman who could not conceive naturally, the physical &amp; emotional pain that finally lead to a twin pregnancy and motherhood.
It was very important for me to tell my story. When I was going through all those fertility treatments, I had no one to fall back on. I had no book to read. I did not have anyone to tell me how a procedure would take place. It was then, that I decided that educating women facing this situation was important. This thought gave birth to my book. It was time to remove the taboo surrounding the words Fertility Treatment. 
My Frozen Embryo is a personal journey towards parenthoodthe journey, I so proudly narrate today." />
