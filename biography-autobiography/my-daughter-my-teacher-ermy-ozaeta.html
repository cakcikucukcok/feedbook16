  <title>My Daughter My Teacher - Ermy Ozaeta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;For years, I had been contemplating on writing a book. I just could not decide what to write about. Several ideas floated through my head but somehow, none of them stayed long enough. And then it happened: a confrontation with my daughter that shook me to the core. I decided to embark on this difficult journey of remembering in the hope that I may spare some parents the pain I went through. I also wanted to explore the idea of unconditional love. At first, I did not know what these words truly meant; only that its supposed to be the kind of love parents are expected to have for their children. It seemed easy enough. After all, I have always felt the call to motherhood at the core of my being. Just love your child, right? But how? For someone who grew up without any role model for a mother, for someone forced by circumstances to raise her child alone, it can be quite a challenge.&quot;" />
