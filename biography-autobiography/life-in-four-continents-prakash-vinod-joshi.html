  <title>Life in Four Continents - Prakash  Vinod Joshi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The highest accolade I can give Prakash is to say he is a humanitarian. He has great empathy for all kinds of people he encountered in east Africa where he grew up, in the United Kingdom where he studied Industrial Chemistry, and in Canada where he makes his home today and works with Metro Testing and Engineering Services Limited as a Senior Materials Engineering Technologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is also an internationalist who seeks to understand the richness of the human spirit through great spiritual leaders past and present like Mahatma Gandhi of India, Dalai Lama of Tibet, the Reverend Desmond Tutu of South Africa, and Spiritual Chiefs of our Native North American Indians. He has given back to his community in Canada and is a respected member of his profession. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just finished your book while sitting by the pool. I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. I like the way you presented the story and the honesty of the message. I can totally see you welcoming a stranger to your home as you did on several occasions to provide them with comforts at the expense of you and your family. In fact, the message you leave the reader with you is became richer for having the experience to assist one less fortunate than you. Well done my friend! Undoubtably you have taught your children and those close to you what it means to be a special person who demonstrates a real love for life.&lt;p&gt;
All the best,
&lt;p&gt;Rob Deverall" />
