  <title>The True Value of Suffering - Kevin Loftus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The odyssey of a family battling for the life of a child who suffers from leukemia, meningitis, strokes, being comatose, paralysis, seizures and flatling three times. Having overcome the initial acute medical challenges and in attempting to find a sense of normalcy in everyday life the family struggles with their experiences in dealing with  careers, insurance companies, school systems, teachers, doctors and lawyers. Told through the eyes of the young girls father and central to the story are the devastating blows to relationships, the financial and emotional struggles, and the lifeline that Christian faith provides. The vacillations in health and the years of suffering provide a genuine lens into a faith walk that goes through numerous deserts; the oasis of which is undeniable, dramatic and promises the reader that God is intimately connected. Insights gleaned along the way while going through years of seemingly insurmountable challenges are shared in a positive, uplifting manner focusing on the understanding, joy and inner peace they ultimately led to." />
