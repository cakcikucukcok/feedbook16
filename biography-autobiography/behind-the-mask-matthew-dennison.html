  <title>Behind the Mask - Matthew Dennison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A dazzling new biography of Vita Sackville-West, the 20th century aristocrat, literary celebrity, devoted wife, famous lover of Virginia Woolf, recluse, and iconoclast who defied categorization.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this stunning new biography of Vita Sackville-West, Matthew Dennison&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Behind the Mask &lt;/i&gt;traces the triumph and contradictions of Vita&#39;s extraordinary life. His narrative charts a fascinating course from Vita&#39;s lonely childhood at Knole, through her affectionate but &#39;open&#39; marriage to Harold Nicolson (during which both husband and wife energetically pursued homosexual affairs, Vita most famously with Virginia Woolf), and through Vita&#39;s literary successes and disappointments, to the famous gardens the couple created at Sissinghurst. The book tells how, from her privileged world of the aristocracy, Sackville-West brought her penchant for costume, play-acting and rebellion to the artistic vanguard of modern Britain. Dennison is the acclaimed author of many books including a biography of Queen Victoria. Here, in the first biography to be written of Vita for thirty years, he reveals the whole story and gets behind &#39;the beautiful mask&#39; of Vita&#39;s public achievements to reveal an often troubled persona which heroically resisted compromise on every level. Drawing on wideranging sources and the extensive letters that sustained her marriage, this is a compelling story of love, loss and jealousy, of high-life and low points, of binding affection and illicit passion - a portrait of an extraordinary, 20th-century life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
