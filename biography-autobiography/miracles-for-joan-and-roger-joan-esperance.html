  <title>Miracles for Joan and Roger - Joan Esperance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this delightful book, Australian Joan Esperance reflects back over her life and the lives of her pioneer ancestors.  Joan&#39;s journey begins in rural Australia and takes the reader on travels including hitchhiking from the Arctic Circle, through Europe, to the Sahara Desert, where she was entertained by members of the French Foreign Legion, then to life in Canada and, finally, the United States.    In San Francisco, Joan met the great love of her life, Roger.  But tragedy struck when just months after they fell in love, Roger had major life saving heart surgery, which left him brain damaged and paralysed.  Despite understanding the challenges this would create, Joan married Roger and cared for him for thirty-five years.  Throughout this time, God performed miracle after miracle, ranging from saving Roger&#39;s life on many occasions, to giving Joan simple but precious gifts which helped her to continue in her difficult caring role.        The book is a moving testimony to a woman who dared to live her life with God, and to that God who walked with her through many adventures. It will be particularly helpful to those seeking a closer, more adventurous walk with their Maker." />
