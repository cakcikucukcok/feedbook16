  <title>Speed Bumps and Angels - Cherie Kirby Hill Wren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tornado warnings were posted in Canton, Ohio, on the night of author Cherie Kirby Hill Wrens birth in 1943. The storm was just a normal occurrence, but she cant help think it was a precursor of her life to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Speed Bumps and Angels,&lt;/i&gt; Wren recaps the storms and speed bumps she has experienced in her life: nearly drowning when she was just two years old; being hit by a car; getting jilted, twice; running away from home and marrying a man who was abusive and ultimately tried to kill her; developing type 2 diabetes; being diagnosed with benign essential blepharospasm; having her mitral and aortic valves replaced; gaining a pacemaker; and enduring pulmonary hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, Wren shows how these bumps served their purpose. First, they slowed her down so she didnt run out of control. Second, they gave her a little jolt, sometimes back to reality. Third, they kept her from getting too complacent. She shows that by conquering challenges, we grow and learn. We are here for a purpose, and by living each day to the fullest we can, knowingly or unknowingly, accomplish that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
