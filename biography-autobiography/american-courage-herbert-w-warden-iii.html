  <title>American Courage - Herbert W. Warden, III</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Here is the American adventure. This extraordinary book reveals the intrepid spirit of Americans through-out their history -- from William Bradford&#39;s account of the Mayflower landing to the hardship of a pioneer settler, from little-known stories of great figures to harrowing tales from the Wild West, the World Wars, and September 11, 2001. Told with striking eloquence, these are great American stories, tales of daring, adventure, and bravery told by the people who lived them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawn from firsthand and historical writings, &lt;strong&gt;American Courage&lt;/strong&gt; gives voice to the pilgrims, founding fathers, revolutionaries, pioneers, &#39;49ers, cowboys, soldiers, pilots, and the many other heroes who have built the nation. &lt;strong&gt;Herbert W. Warden III&lt;/strong&gt; has made the whole of American history fresh and palpably alive, revealing the national character through the growth of precarious &quot;New World&quot; settlements to the formation and defense of the United States of America. Warden has gathered amazing true stories of both everyday Americans and our most beloved national figures, including Ben Franklin and Teddy Roosevelt, in a collection that will astound and inspire generations of readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these pages, a Plymouth colonist recounts her abduction by Indians, Ben Franklin recalls his arrival in Philadelphia as a penniless runaway, Daniel Boone explores Kentucky, and George Washington is sent on a perilous winter mission through the wilderness as a twenty-one-year-old soldier. During the Revolutionary period we hear from participants in the Boston Tea Party, about the fates of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and lesser-known tales of courage from the battlefield. From the War of 1812, a privateer writes of battling the British navy. Davy Crockett reports from inside the Alamo. Andrew Jackson survives a duel to the death. From the Civil War era, a slave mother escapes to the North to be with her children and General James Longstreet gives a harrowing account of Pickett&#39;s Charge. Some of the book&#39;s most exciting stories come from the western frontier. Here are unbelievable stories of wrestling grizzly bears, Indian warfare, the Pony Express, and gold-rush prospectors. In the twentieth century, Charles Lindbergh recounts his transatlantic flight, soldiers do battle on D-Day and at Okinawa, civil rights pioneers risk their lives, Americans land on the moon, heroes emerge from the tragedy of September 11, 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Courage&lt;/strong&gt; could not be more timely. Collecting the most daring and exciting reports of American bravery, these are stories of the heart and soul of the country, personal accounts that prove that when the United States is challenged, from the frontier to the Civil War to the space missions to terrorism, individual Americans reveal their true, courageous selves. Highly readable, &lt;strong&gt;American Courage&lt;/strong&gt; is an inspiring chorus of bravery and daring from the men and women whose actions formed a nation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
