  <title>Hiding Man - Tracy Daugherty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s Donald Barthelme came to prominence as the leader of the Postmodern movement. He was a fixture at the New Yorker, publishing more than 100 short stories, including such masterpieces as &quot;Me and Miss Mandible,&quot; the tale of a thirty-five-year-old sent to elementary school by clerical error, and &quot;A Shower of Gold,&quot; in which a sculptor agrees to appear on the existentialist game show Who Am I? He had a dynamic relationship with his father that influenced much of his fiction. He worked as an editor, a designer, a curator, a news reporter, and a teacher. He was at the forefront of literary Greenwich Village which saw him develop lasting friendships with Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, Tom Wolfe, Grace Paley, and Norman Mailer. Married four times, he had a volatile private life. He died of cancer in 1989. The recipient of many prestigious literary awards, he is best remembered for the classic novels &lt;i&gt;Snow White&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Dead Father&lt;/i&gt;, and many short stories, all of which remain in print today.  &lt;i&gt;Hiding Man&lt;/i&gt; is the first biography of Donald Barthelme, and it is nothing short of a masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;" />
