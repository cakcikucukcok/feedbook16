  <title>The God I Love - Joni Eareckson Tada</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“The God I Love is the book that captures my heart and thoughts in the events, dialogues, memories, images, and scenes of my life—my walk with God.”—Joni Eareckson TadaJoni’s name is synonymous around the world with the words “loving God.” She has lived out these words since the diving accident thirty-six years ago that left her paralyzed from the shoulders down. Now in The God I Love she looks back on the whole of her life through eyes that can see how that accident actually moved her in a new direction, saving her from another tragedy of her own making.This story-driven narrative captures the events and images of Joni’s remarkable life as she describes her life in six themes. She begins with her life as an ordinary girl who is blessed by an extraordinary God—but not without tragic turns. Then she ponders the question, would she have been an artist if she had not broken her neck? She recognizes that through prayer she enters into God’s holy presence and finds that he answers her prayers in full measure. She acknowledges that it is only through the kindness of friends that she has bathed or eaten or done the countless simple tasks that make up everyday life. Because of her unusual situation, her wheelchair has rolled onto platforms around the world where millions of people have heard her speak about her Savior. Through tragedy Joni has come to know God, the living, surprising, wonderful Lord of all.A note from Joni—The God I Love is a memory still unfolding of the journey that keeps taking me deeper into the heart of my Savior. It’s my prayer that this story, which spans over fifty years, will resonate with each person who takes time to pick up the book...it’s my prayer that The God I Love will serve as a roadmap, a guide, a signpost to light the journey of each reader, helping them to see their sweet, soft desperation of Jesus, too." />
