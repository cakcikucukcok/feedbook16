  <title>Open Door Closed Closet - Mario Nocentelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Critically Acclaimed Author Mr. Mario Nocentelli, his first book titled &quot;Open Door Closed Closet&quot; Minister Nocentelli deals with subject matter of being delivered from Homosexuality and sexual abuse and sexual sin, while growing up confused in rural Mississippi.
Yes it&#39;s a sad story; however we live in a world where the truth is no longer of value. I have no more secrets! However I am not a bitter person, I am better because of all I have been through.
&quot;I Love God dearly for what he has done in my life and thank him daily for blessing me with my wife Anastasia&quot;...I am a writer and my story is very unique, God delivered me from sexual sin. And my book is a testimony that men and women are not born gay...God is a deliverer and if we really want not to sin and live for him we can. I thank God for the blood of Jesus. We are healed from &quot;All Sin&quot;....
Mario found his passion for writing later in life because of so much transition and inner turmoil he knew he had to give God the glory for all he personally survived. His story is proof that we can be delivered from confusion and sexual sin. 
Born in New Orleans Louisiana reared in Jackson, Mississippi, 
Nocentelli now lives with his beautiful gift from God his wife of over ten years Anastasia in Dallas Texas. Mario has recently released his first novel Open Door, Closed Closet . I just feel it is time for us to stand up and speak out that God can do anything.
Notable Achievements in 2007 an editorial was broadcasted on AIG Comcast News on Marios powerful and moving life story. A journal of his testimony was also written in Isurrender magazine in 2008. After much time and prayer Mario accepted the call that God has placed on his life to minister and share with the world. We hope that God would use his ministry to bless others. Not just homosexuality, but sexual sin as a whole. We need to talk about the pink elephant in the room..." />
