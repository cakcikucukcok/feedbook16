  <title>Gunz and God: The Life of an NYPD Undercover - Stevie Stryker, Rocco Parascandola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the real-life story of Stevie Stryker, who grew up in a tough Brooklyn neighborhood, then became an NYPD undercover - Stevie Gunz, his fellow officers called him. He locked up countless bad guys using his biggest asset, his ability to talk. It&#39;s a skill he learned as a kid in church, where he listened, not always willingly, as his father, a strict Pentecostal minister, held sway with his mesmerizing sermons. But Stryker broke his father&#39;s heart, joining the Marines instead of heading right to college. After retiring from the NYPD due to a debilitating illness, he paid his father the biggest compliment he could, becoming a minister and preaching the word of God.   The New York Times calls &quot;Gunz and God&quot; an &quot;audacious autobiography&quot; filled with &quot;rollicking capers, which read like TV scripts.&quot;" />
