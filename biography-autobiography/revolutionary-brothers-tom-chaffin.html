  <title>Revolutionary Brothers - Tom Chaffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In a narrative both panoramic and intimate, Tom Chaffin captures the four-decade friendship of Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette shared a singularly extraordinary friendship, one involved in the making of two revolutions--and two nations. Jefferson first met Lafayette in 1781, when the young French-born general was dispatched to Virginia to assist Jefferson, then the state&#39;s governor, in fighting off the British. The charismatic Lafayette, hungry for glory, could not have seemed more different from Jefferson, the reserved statesman. But when Jefferson, a newly-appointed diplomat, moved to Paris three years later, speaking little French and in need of a partner, their friendship began in earnest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As Lafayette opened doors in Paris and Versailles for Jefferson, so too did the Virginian stand by Lafayette as the Frenchman became inexorably drawn into the maelstrom of his country&#39;s revolution. Jefferson counseled Lafayette as he drafted &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Declaration of the Rights of Man&lt;/i&gt; and remained a firm supporter of the French Revolution, even after he returned to America in 1789. By 1792, however, the upheaval had rendered Lafayette a man without a country, locked away in a succession of Austrian and Prussian prisons. The burden fell on Jefferson and Lafayette&#39;s other friends to win his release. The two would not see each other again until 1824, in a powerful and emotional reunion at Jefferson&#39;s Monticello.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Steeped in primary sources, &lt;i&gt;Revolutionary Brothers&lt;/i&gt; casts fresh light on this remarkable, often complicated, friendship of two extraordinary men.&lt;/p&gt;" />
