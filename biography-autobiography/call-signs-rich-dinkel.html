  <title>Call Signs - Rich Dinkel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Call Signs&lt;/i&gt;, former naval aviator Rich Dinkel shares memories and personal stories of several of the brave men and women who shared the profession. These flyers must be able to execute their orders in any circumstance, time, or climate. They are sharply skilled professionals who train and retrain constantly. Each naval aviator has their own call signtheir personal pseudonym, to be used during their service and most likely for many years after their service has ended. Dinkel uses the call signs of his former colleagues as he tells their stories.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Tactical aviation is often described as a very risky business in the eyes of everyday people. Todays fighter and attack aircraft can take-off and land on a runway and shoot off the bow (front) of an aircraft carrier, and be recovered in the cross-deck pendants at the stern (rear) of the ship. In order to perform this sort of flying, a pilot must have steely eyes with perfect vision; quick, cat-like refl exes; and exceptional common sensesomething that can occasionally be problematic. He or she must also have a deep and wide knowledge of every system in the aircraft, an equally in depth knowledge of the enemy, and the proper way to use his or her deadly weapons in combat.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Call Signs&lt;/i&gt; offers personal stories and a unique insiders view of tactical aviation and the challenges that each pilot must meet to succeed.&lt;/P&gt;" />
