  <title>The Last Wild West - Neil H Atkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of a man wanting to move forward by travelling back to where he was born, the Northern Territory. Finding himself on a merciless cattle station where you weren&#39;t taught to be a stockman but broken to fit into the mould, he is caught in the middle of race wars and deadly violence between white station managers and Aboriginal traditional land owners. As black power surges, his sympathy grows for an Indigenous elder and his besieged community... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;It was like reading parts of Alex Haley&#39;s Roots, only it happened in Australia. The tale of brutality and injustice in an indifferent country&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;Geoff McDonald, author of Red Over Black &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;The writer looked death in the face to protect his Aboriginal friends, we owe it to put our hands up and support his story. Made me angry, sad and proud but couldn&#39;t put it down. A must read for all Australian&#39;s as it exposes a dark, mostly unknown part of our race relations most people would rather not know, but need to see to remind them standing up to racism demands constant vigil&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;quot; Reggie Jobuda, Council of Aboriginal Elders and Indigenous Advancement." />
