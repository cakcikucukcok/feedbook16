  <title>When Your Drugs Don&#39;t Work But Make You Sick - Regine Dubono</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a mother discovers that the drugs her daughter has been prescribed are making her physically and mentally ill, she tries to have the group home decrease them in stages and find herself fighting against an invincible system. That system includes the regulatory organizations, the funding organizations and of course the pharmaceutical companies who make the drugs. However the drug manufacturers do not recommend the mixing of drugs which is being practiced in 24/7 group homes, and which is a requirement for food and shelter there.  Nor do they recommend use of their drugs for more than 1-4 months.  This book is a revolt against prolonged  use of the drugs for years and years in the absence of active symptoms to justify their use.  It is a system that leads to permanent disability and early death, and serves no utilitarian purpose.  In fact it is highly unethical and goes against the HHS and NIH regulations.  This is a book written in pursuit of the truth." />
