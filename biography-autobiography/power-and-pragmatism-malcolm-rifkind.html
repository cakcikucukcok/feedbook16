  <title>Power and Pragmatism - Malcolm Rifkind</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sir Malcolm Rifkind&#39;s political career has been as glittering as it has been long-lived. Indeed, he served as a minister for eighteen years, longer uninterrupted service than anyone since Lord Palmerston in the nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Informed and stimulating, but also more relaxed, amusing and readable than most books of this genre, Rifkind&#39;s memoirs include his battles with Margaret Thatcher over Scotland, explain how he helped change Polish history during the Cold War, describe his presence at the Gorbachev-Thatcher summit and tell how he served as both Defence Minister and Foreign Secretary during some of the most turbulent years of the late twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book also covers Rifkind&#39;s five pivotal years as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, working with MI6, the CIA and both spies and those spied upon.  For his robustness, he is currently banned from Russia by President Putin. Rifkind&#39;s memoir is serious and funny, wise and self-deprecatory. This is a book about the past and the future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
