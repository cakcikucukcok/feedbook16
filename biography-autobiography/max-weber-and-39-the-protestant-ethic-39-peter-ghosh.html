  <title>Max Weber and &#39;The Protestant Ethic&#39; - Peter Ghosh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Max Weber and The Protestant Ethic: Twin Histories presents an entirely new portrait of Max Weber, one of the most prestigious social theorists in recent history, using his most famous work, The Protestant Ethic and the &quot;Spirit&quot; of Capitalism, as its central point of reference. It offers an intellectual biography of Weber framed along historical lines - something which has never been done before. It re-evaluates The Protestant
Ethic — a text surprisingly neglected by scholars — supplying a missing intellectual and chronological centre to Weber&#39;s life and work.
Peter Ghosh suggests that The Protestant Ethic is the link which unites the earlier (pre-1900) and later (post-1910) phases of his career. He offers a series of fresh perspectives on Weber&#39;s thought in various areas — charisma, capitalism, law, politics, rationality, bourgeois life, and (not least) Weber&#39;s unusual religious thinking, which was &#39;remote from god&#39; yet based on close dialogue with Christian theology. This approach produces a convincing view of Max Weber as a whole; while
previously the sheer breadth of his intellectual interests has caused him to be read in a fragmentary way according to a series of specialized viewpoints, this volume seeks to put him back together again as a real individual." />
