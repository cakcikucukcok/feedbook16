Award-winning baseball historian Glenn Stout reveals brand-new information about Babe and the unique political situation surrounding his sale, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Prohibition and the lifting of Blue Laws in New York affected Yankees owner and beer baron Jacob Ruppert&lt;br&gt;-Previously unexplored documents reveal that the mortgage of Fenway Park did not factor into the Ruth sale&lt;br&gt;-          Ruth&#39;s disruptive influence on the Red Sox in 1918 and 1919, including  sabermetrics  showing his negative impact on the team as he went from pitcher to outfielder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Selling of the Babe&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to focus on the ramifications of the sale and captures the central moment of Ruth&#39;s evolution from player to icon, and will appeal to fans of &lt;i&gt;The Kid&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pinstripe Empire&lt;/i&gt;. Babe&#39;s sale to New York and the subsequent selling of Ruth to America led baseball from the Deadball Era and sparked a new era in the game, one revolved around the long ball and one man, The Babe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
