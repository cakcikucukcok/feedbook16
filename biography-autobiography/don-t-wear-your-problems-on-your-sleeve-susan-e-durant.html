  <title>Don’T Wear Your Problems on Your Sleeve - Susan E. Durant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is the story of an incredible journey. It is the odyssey of recovery. This is a firsthand account of what it takes to overcome the greatest theft; the stolen self. This is the story of the recovery of a shattered spirit. This is an account of what gauntlets must be run to experience the ultimate victory. The victory of self actualization. In the end all we search for is ourselves. This book is about what ways, what mazes, what illusions, what lies, what inheritances we must live to break apart and free ourselves from. We must own every tragic mystery in order to let each mysterious secret go. The path to humility is the road less traveled. From the words of Robert Frost: This is an autobiography of a girl who took the road less traveled and it has made all the difference.
                 The great paradox is; the gift is not the Divine providence of freedom from the fear of being ones&#39; self. The end result is not about being who we are. The gift is the purpose that blooms from such manifest; the benevolent opportunity to expose the path to someone else. There is no end result. As the purpose of life becomes apparent it expands as light outside the hard borders of materialism. That light is love, a governing energy little recognized and eternally sought. This is a story of a girl who struggles through each level and  into womanhood to find what love really is. That flame so sought, no longer a flicker so small its source is questionable, is  become a fire that is undeniable as the light and warmth it heaves out is seen and felt by the most blind and bitterly cold." />
