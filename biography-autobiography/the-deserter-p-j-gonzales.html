  <title>The Deserter - P. J. Gonzales</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Japanese occupation of the Philippines began simultaneously with the attack on Pearl Harbor. The estimated costs to human lives was unimaginable as written in history. There were a few who lived to tell their story. The book is based on the true accounts of a soldier as it was narrated over time. From his war experiences were derived many compositions and essays by the same author, but his identity was never revealed due to possible implications that may affect the life he chose and lived after the war. The manuscript of The Deserter was written many years ago. As it was taken very seriously not to omit any details if let known, the need for publication nullified the urgency until it was decided how the book would be presented without the narration being upsetting. To know about the book is to read it in its entirety because the author himself could not find ways to transform the story into a few words." />
