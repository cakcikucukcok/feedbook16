  <title>Uncle Bob &amp; the Road to the Devil Saloon - Patrick D. Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Uncle Bob, Robert E. Lee Leavitt, was a true pioneer of the Wild West. This is his story, and that of his family, friends and fellow pioneers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story tells of Uncle Bobs forbearers as they ventured from Germany and Ireland to Americas shores, and traveled to what is now the city of Victoria, in southeast Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, Uncle Bob leads a historic cattle drive to Montana, participated in crucial battles with the Comanche Indians, ultimately settling in a small Montana town where he ends up staying to run a red-light saloon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Uncle Bobs story is told by himself, as well as by those who knew him best.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Uncle Bob, a man who knew triumph and defeat, jubilation and sorrow, displays the American Experience with all of its true grit, as well as its uncanny humor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
