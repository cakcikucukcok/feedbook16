      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This delighful book of memoirs, short stories, and poems describes some of the events of his life that leads him to say in his retirement years, This is one great trip and Im so grateful to all the saints and scoundrels that have made it so much fun. It is well written, loaded with charming characters, and a hopefully a model for readers in maintaining a positive attitude through challenges and chuckles. You will not forget how he got airsick in his first ever job interview, or when he was caught stretching the truth in front of a beer soaked audience,, or his survival with women through paralyzing shyness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stories start with his birth into a middle class family, proud of its Scottish traditions, through the school years to a successful dental practice in a small Cape Cod village and his delight at some of the colorful characters along the way. He is still searching by volunteering in Haiti and Africa and trying to lend a helping hand to people in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has now retired to Hilton Head Island in South Carolina where he teaches English to immigrants, assists at the Boys and Girls Club, and tries to enjoy each moment. He especially looks forward to returning to Ghana and hugging the beautiful children at the orphanage school.&lt;/p&gt;" />
