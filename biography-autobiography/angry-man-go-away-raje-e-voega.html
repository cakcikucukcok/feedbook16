  <title>Angry Man! Go Away! - Raje E. Voega</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Angry Man! Go Away! presents the true story of the life of author Raje E. Voega, who was raised by an abusive father who beat his mother and him often. The oldest of eight children, he was very harsh with his siblings due to his fathers actions; even so, as an adult he has never hit or been violent with anyone.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Voega was born on the western coast of Canada and moved to Alberta when he was almost six. As a child, he was moved around a lot, from Edmonton to northern Alberta. At fifteen, he went to live with his father in Edmonton but only stayed for six months, although he remained in the area until he was nineteen. Eventually, he moved from that area and settled in western Canada, finally ending up in southern Alberta. In his early twenties, he started down a path that might have led his imprisonment or death, but he was able to turn his life around.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Recently, he ended a relationship that put him in a very dark and hopeless place. But instead of crossing a line that would have destroyed both his life and others lives forever, he decided to write about the violence that exists in families today. By telling his story in this memoir, he hopes to save others from the violence that he has endured, and at times created, in his family.&lt;/P&gt;" />
