  <title>Steps - Patricia Vaccarino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Steps is a business book, but it is more than an ordinary business book. It encompasses the concept of business + dance = brand philosophy, and yet the term branding is rarely mentioned. Here, in Steps, I am suggesting that you should not even consider building your professional brand unless you are willing to do the hard work the same way a dancer learns technique, movement and artistry. You can&amp;rsquo;t build a brand unless you are willing to explore excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through hard work and devotion, I have come to know that dance is a great metaphor for life and for business. From my world view, I equate life with business. And good business practices are as essential to your lives as every breath we take. Good business means you are performing well&amp;mdash;to the best of your ability. Whether anyone is watching you or not does not matter. What matters is you do your best to hit your own marks.&lt;/p&gt;" />
