      <meta name="description" content="The true account of the life of 485 New Zealand Spitfire Squadron sergeant pilot from South Auckland, who in the words of fellow WW2 fighter pilot Johnnie Houlton,, was a happy-go-lucky type, with a gift for getting himself into trouble without even trying. In the words of another friend and pilot, Max Collett, he was as mad as a March hare...! As an average young colonial lad exemplifying exuberance in youth, the author&#39;s namesake, Clinton McInnes, would challenge his father in stepping up to the challenges and hardships of the war, and ultimately life itself ...... He would achieve his aspiration and dream of flying for his hoped for squadron, along with finally being awarded Pilot Officer status. In living his young life to the full he would discover friendship and his love in family, to leave his mark for posterity. In so doing he would unwittingly prove Pilot Officer Prune&#39;s contention that apples, if they were our genes, do not fall far from their tree." />
