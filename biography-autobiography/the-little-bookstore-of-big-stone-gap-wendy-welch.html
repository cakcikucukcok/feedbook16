  <title>The Little Bookstore of Big Stone Gap - Wendy Welch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An inspiring true story about losing your place, finding your purpose, and building a community one book at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wendy Welch and her husband had always dreamed of owning a bookstore, so when they left their high-octane jobs for a simpler life in an Appalachian coal town, they seized an unexpected opportunity to pursue thier dream. The only problems? A declining U.S. economy, a small town with no industry, and the advent of the e-book. They also had no idea how to run a bookstore. Against all odds, but with optimism, the help of their Virginian mountain community, and an abiding love for books, they succeeded in establishing more than a thriving business - they built a community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Little Bookstore of Big Stone Gap&lt;/i&gt; is the little bookstore that could: how two people, two cats, two dogs, and thirty-eight thousand books helped a small town find its heart. It is a story about people and books, and how together they create community.&lt;/p&gt;" />
