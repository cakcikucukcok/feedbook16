  <title>Beyond the Fire and the Rain - Wilbert Williams Jr. M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In July 1978, Dr. Wilbert Williams Jr. was standing on a street 
corner in Brooklyn, New York, afraid for his life. It had been less 
than three months since he was awarded a medical degree from 
Albany Medical College in upstate New York; yet there he 
wasenduring racial slurs from a group of angry white people who 
hated him simply because of the color of his skin. Even as the 
police stood guarding him, the group continued to taunt him with 
the words, He can go back where he came from. &lt;p&gt;
In his poignant memoir, Williams narrates the story of how he beat 
overwhelming odds, as an African American youth growing up in a 
public housing project in Brooklyn, New York, to eventually become 
a physician. While chronicling a journey that took him from the 
streets of New York through the challenges of medical school to 
the beautiful Caribbean island of St. Croix, he details how he 
learned to prevail over racism, anxiety, and depression in order to 
achieve his dream of becoming a doctor.&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Williamss inspiring story offers motivation to soar over the 
challenges of life and reach for the stars.&lt;p&gt;" />
