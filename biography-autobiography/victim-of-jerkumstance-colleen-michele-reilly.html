  <title>Victim of Jerkumstance - Colleen Michele Reilly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bitter and broken after the end of her abusive marriage, Colleen vows to never date anyone again. But with encouragement from others, she finally decides to give love one last chance. Submitting a profile to a dating site, she encounters a myriad of men who are less than honest, and few appear to be who they have described in their profiles. She finds humor in the contradiction of who they have said they were and the reality of who they really appear to be.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eventually, after feeling as though she was careful in her selection, Colleen does meet one man she hopes will be part of her future. Unfortunately, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t see that her life will be altered entirely before she finally realizes he is nothing more than a conman set out to ruin the lives of others to benefit his own. Will she realize this before her entire life has been stolen from her?&lt;/p&gt;" />
