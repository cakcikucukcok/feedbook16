  <title>Confessions of a Marijuana Eater: A Songwriter&#39;s Memoir - Bobby Gosh, McSherry W Joseph, West J Michael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Songwriter Bobby Gosh&amp;#39;s memoir Confessions of a Marijuana Eater is part biography, popular music history, personal philosophy, and of course, public acknowledgement of his career-spanning use of marijuana/cannabis. By 1952, when Gosh started touring, using marijuana was not something one publicized. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics called it the &amp;quot;devil weed and intended to round up musicians who played &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; music - jazz - on marijuana charges; the exploitative film &amp;quot;Reefer Madness&amp;quot; was on the circuit through the 1940s and &amp;#39;50s, and cannabis use was criminalized and mandatory minimum sentences established. Needless to say, Bobby Gosh&amp;#39;s concern about &amp;quot;coming out&amp;quot; as a marijuana user was well justified. It is only now in his 2016 memoir Confessions of a Marijuana Eater: A Songwriter&amp;#39;s Memoir that Gosh makes public his life story, successful musical career, and advocacy for cannabis policy reform.&lt;/p&gt;" />
