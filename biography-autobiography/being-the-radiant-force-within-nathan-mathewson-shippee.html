&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt&quot;&gt;During the course of preparing for publication, many personal interviews were made in a test of the present stage of awareness of an individuals sense of self, of who the I am really is. These interviews were generally spontaneous, conducted in a natural setting during a conversation in which I would take advantage of a pause and quietly say:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt 0.5in&quot;&gt;I am going to ask you three questions which will change your awareness of who you really are. You will simply give me one-word answers, and by doing so you will begin to think of yourself in a new way.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in&quot;&gt;First: Are you more than a body?&lt;BR&gt;Yes, I am more than a body&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in&quot;&gt;Second: Since you are more than a body, what is the more?&lt;BR&gt;What is the more than my body? My Soul.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in&quot;&gt;Third: Since your soul is more than your bodythink noware you a body &lt;U&gt;with&lt;/U&gt; a soul, or are you a soul &lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;in&lt;/I&gt; a body? Which has domain, your body or your soul?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt 0.5in&quot;&gt;Which is the real you?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt 1in; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;(Longer pause)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt 1in; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;Most replied by saying I am a soul &lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;in&lt;/I&gt; a body.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt; TEXT-ALIGN: center&quot; align=center&gt;**********&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt&quot;&gt;With or in is determinative, and the one you choose, like a fork in the road, will control your path ahead.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt&quot;&gt;If one chooses with, it is an admission that &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;Darwin&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is right; we are Homo sapiens, intelligent animals descended from the ape. As Donald Trump said, Life is what you do when you are waiting to die.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt&quot;&gt;If one chooses in, then one believes we cannot die. We are Human Beings, ascended from within, on the earth but not of it, destined to graduate when our bodies die and we return to the universe from whence we came as Souls in the form of radiant energy.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 12pt 0in 6pt&quot;&gt;The key to the fork in the road is awareness, for we become as we think. Who we think we are is that which we become. Descended from the ape or ascended from within, there is magic in the awakening of awareness of who is in control during our time of life on earth, and the personal awareness of who I am ignites the presence of enthusiasm within us&lt;I style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal&quot;&gt;&lt;U&gt;entheos&lt;/U&gt;:&lt;/I&gt; God within.&lt;/P&gt;
