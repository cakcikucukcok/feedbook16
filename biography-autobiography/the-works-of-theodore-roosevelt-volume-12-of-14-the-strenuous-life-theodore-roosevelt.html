  <title>The Works of Theodore Roosevelt, Volume 12 (of 14) / The Strenuous Life - Theodore Roosevelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Teddy Roosevelt lived a full and accomplished life and shared many of his beliefs in this book, in which he tells how to live life to its most productive and fullest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone considering public life&amp;mdash;whether as a politician, a pastor, or any other leader of people&amp;mdash;ought to study Teddy Roosevelt. &amp;ldquo;Latitude and Longitude Among Reformers&amp;rdquo; is the most worthy speech in this collection, a speech that extols the twin dangers of inefficiency and unrighteousness. Expediency should never come at the cost of unrighteousness, TR warns, but an untethered idealism that despises the compromises and small victories of public life is the sign of a deficient man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not so much book as it is speech (given 1905 in Chicago), this is a great little read about the emphasis on Americans remaining hard working. Or at least that they should remain hard working, even though a life of luxury was more easily accessible than ever before. Look it up and give it a read, if you believe in America you will like what it says.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A series of essays and speeches from Theodore Roosevelt, mostly focusing on having a strong work ethic, Christian fellowship, and the greatness of the American people in the aftermath of two wars; the Civil War and the Spanish-American War, which Roosevelt fought in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the various speeches and essays included here, Roosevelt&amp;#39;s main points revolve around American leadership and what makes for a great citizen in the republic. This, unfortunately, is at the disservice of Native Americans and anyone from a non-Christian religion. However, other than this glaring xenophobic streak, there is a lot of good in what Roosevelt has to say." />
