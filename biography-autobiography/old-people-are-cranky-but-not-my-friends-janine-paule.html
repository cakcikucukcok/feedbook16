  <title>Old People Are Cranky but Not My Friends - Janine Paule</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Old People Are Cranky, But Not My Friends is an interesting, although unusual book of biographies of people who have lived their life in previous generations and mainly in their prime, in decades 1970s to 1990s. 
The stories describe each person who had such an effect on me. The chapters are based on my experience with them and I decided to write my memories for my readers to know how colourful my life has been, due to the influence they have had on it. 
These people are my inspiration to be strong enough to face every challenge and to enjoy what life can offer. You only live once so you must be prepared to make the most out of it. 
Meeting such special characters, indeed a dying breed and a type not to be met again, only increased the quality of my life. 
I hope you enjoy my book and can feel their charisma coming through clearly in my writing. I feel that the pictures and documents have enriched the text and should help the younger generation to understand more about the written description of each person mentioned." />
