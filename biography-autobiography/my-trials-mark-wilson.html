  <title>My Trials - Mark Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marks story begins several years back when he ventured to a foreign country for unique career-building experiences. It is there he eventually met more and more like-minded individuals and someone who appeared extra special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same-aged woman was on her game as she presented a convincing picture of virtue. Mark had no idea that he was about to become quite the victim of a high-functioning, proactively religious psychopath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark beautifully illustrated how counterintuitive his experiences with a psychopath were and goes in great depth to show how these abuser victim roles play out in real life encounters. This is interesting information that is often not included in other books on the same subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sharing how he figured his way through his extended encounter with a primary psychopath, he seeks to spread awareness which will help members of our global society identify psychopaths before they cause their applicable levels of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the author to educate yourself on the increasingly trending topic of psychopathy. There are many things Mark assists you in taking away from encounters with psychopaths and their influence on the world around us. Psychopathy is certainly a topic worth getting a grasp over. Look into this critically constructed book and youll be happy you did!&lt;/p&gt;" />
