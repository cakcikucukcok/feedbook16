  <title>The Other Side of the Tiber - Wallis Wilde-Menozzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A moving and illuminating memoir about a singular woman&#39;s relationship with a fascinating and complex country&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fresh, nuanced perspective on a profoundly perplexing country: this is what Wallis Wilde-Menozzi&#39;s unique, captivating narrative promises--and delivers.&lt;br&gt;     &lt;i&gt;The Other Side of the Tiber&lt;/i&gt; brings Italy to life in an entirely new way, treating the peninsula as a series of distinct places, subjects, histories, and geographies bound together by a shared sense of life. A multifaceted image of Italy emerges--in beautiful black-and-white photographs, many taken by Wilde-Menozzi herself--as does a portrait of the author. Wilde-Menozzi, who has written about Italy for nearly forty years, offers unexpected conclusions about one of the most complex and best-loved countries in the world.&lt;br&gt;     Beginning her story with a hitchhiking trip to Rome when she was a student in England, she illuminates a passionate, creative, and vocal people who are often confined to stereotypes. Earthquakes and volcanoes; a hundred-year-old man; Siena as a walled city; Keats in Rome; the refugee camp of Manduria; the Slow Food movement; realism in Caravaggio; the concept of good and evil; Mary the Madonna as a subject--from these varied angles, Wilde-Menozzi traces a society skeptical about competition and tolerant of contradiction. Bringing them together in the present, she suggests the compensations of the Italians&#39; long view of time. Like the country, this book will inspire discussion and revisiting.&lt;/p&gt;" />
