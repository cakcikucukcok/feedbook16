  <title>David Steel - David Torrance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michael Foot was speaking affectionately when in 1979 he quipped that David Steel had apparently gone from &#39;rising hope to elder statesman&#39; without any intervening period whatsoever. But the remark also neatly captured a career which had seen &#39;the Boy David&#39; enter the House of Commons aged only twenty-six, become leader of the Liberal Party in 1976 (at thirty-eight years old one of the youngest party leaders in British history) and then, within months of his election, lead his party into a controversial Lib-Lab Pact with James Callaghan&#39;s Labour government. Taking the lead in demanding cooperation with the new Social Democratic Party, Steel helped the Alliance poll an unprecedented share of the vote for a third party in the 1983 election. Alongside David Owen of the SDP, he fought another memorable election four years later as one of the &#39;two Davids&#39; and later became the major force behind the troubled birth of the Liberal Democrat Party. Based on extensive interviews and fresh archival research, this biography - with which Steel has cooperated - charts both the &#39;rising hope&#39; and &#39;elder statesman&#39; phases in Steel&#39;s career, as well as his role as the first Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament and his political legacy in light of the post-2010 Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition." />
