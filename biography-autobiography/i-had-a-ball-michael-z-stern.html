  <title>I Had a Ball - Michael Z. Stern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Knowing how much Mom liked Michael Stern, I knew his book would be honestand it is. &lt;i&gt;I HAD A BALL&lt;/i&gt; is full of stories no one but Michael would know. His friendship with Mom is evident on every page. A good read. Thank you Michael.&lt;br&gt;
DESI ARNAZ JR .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michaels memories are my memories, only &lt;u&gt;clearer&lt;/u&gt;. What a talent for details! It was very moving for me to relive so much of our lives through Michaels eyes. Very entertaining. Charming. And, more importantly, &lt;u&gt;true&lt;/u&gt;. As Mom wrote on one of her photos to him, Happy Thoughts.&lt;br&gt;
LUCIE ARNAZ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1971, ten-year-old Michael Stern thought he had died and gone to heaven as he watched a filming of &lt;i&gt;Heres Lucy&lt;/i&gt;. He was enthralled with a redhead gifted with beauty, stage presence, and the ability to make others laugh. Over the next few years, he would attend several more filmings, meet Lucy, and eventually become (in Lucys own words) her number-one fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his memoir, Michael Stern offers a refreshing glimpse into the life of a natural comedienne and actress as he provides a fascinating narrative on what it was like to become first a fan and then a friend with one of the biggest television personalities of all time. Known to fans simply as Lucy, she entertained millions of people across the world with shows like &lt;i&gt;I Love Lucy&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; The Lucy Show&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Heres Lucy&lt;/i&gt;. But to Michael, who was eventually allowed access into her private world, she was a fascinating woman with whom he would share many unforgettable adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Had a Ball&lt;/i&gt; is a unique tribute to Lucys legacy, her spirit, her talent, and her enthusiasm for lifesure to entertain Lucy fans, television aficionados, and comedy lovers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
