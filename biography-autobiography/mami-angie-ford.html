  <title>#Mami - Angie Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The story of my Mami&amp;rsquo;s life and the impact that she had on so many. Growing up I always knew that my Mother (#Mami) was a very special soul. She had unique qualities that were exemplified in the ways that she met and kept people around her. She had a way of making everyone feel special. Mami was the most beautiful soul that I ever met. Mami never compared us, she always encouraged and taught us how to survive in this world. I never really understood the impact Mami had in this world until she died on March 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2017. I knew she was special, but after that dreadful day, I was filled with joy and comfort to hear the things that people who knew Mami well and those who barely knew her, were saying about her. Meaning that it did not take long for Mami to plant her seeds of wisdom and joy in the hearts of people that she met along her journey of life on this earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my sisters and me, our relationship with Mami was just the norm. Little did we know, what we had with Mami was not really the norm for the rest of the world. We assumed it was. Mother/daughter relationships can be so difficult for so many people and I am finding that out now. For us, it was smooth because Mami always found a balance to ensure that nobody felt left out or less than. She spread her love evenly across. I never felt like she loved me any more or less than my siblings. She didn&amp;rsquo;t only do this with us. She did this with her godchildren, grandchildren, nieces/nephews, siblings, friends and even strangers. She had a way of connecting with people instantly and they seem to not be able to get enough of her. She was truly an angel on earth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
