  <title>Seducing Ingrid Bergman - Chris Greenhalgh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The beautiful Casablanca star, the world&#39;s greatest war photographer, and the secret love affair that would change their lives forever . . . in Chris Greenhalgh&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Seducing Ingrid Bergman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;June 1945. When Ingrid Bergman walks into the lobby of the Ritz hotel in Paris, war photographer Robert Capa is enchanted. From the moment he slips a mischievous invitation to dinner under her door, the two find themselves helplessly attracted. Played out against the cafés and nightclubs of post-war Paris and the parties and studios of Hollywood, they pursue an intense and increasingly reckless affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the light-hearted Capa, who likes nothing more than to spend his mornings reading in the tub and his afternoons at the racetrack, is not all that he seems. And Ingrid offers the promise of salvation to a man haunted by the horrors of war, his father&#39;s suicide, and the death of a former lover for which he blames himself. Addicted to risk, Capa must wrestle his devils, including gambling and drink, and resist an impulse to go off and photograph yet another war. &lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Ingrid, trapped in a passionless marriage and with a seven-year-old daughter to bring up, must court scandal and risk compromising her Hollywood career and saintly reputation if their love is to survive. With their happiness and identities at stake, both Capa and Ingrid are presented with terrible choices.&lt;/p&gt;" />
