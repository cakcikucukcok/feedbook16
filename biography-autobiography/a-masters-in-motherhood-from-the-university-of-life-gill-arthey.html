  <title>A Masters in Motherhood (From the University of Life) - Gill Arthey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a scan at fourteen weeks clearly reveals a set of natural triplets Eddie and Gill&#39;s lives were about to be changed forever by their early arrival. The story follows the humorous and sometimes chaotic happenings when the triplets, with their powers of &#39;triplepathy&#39; quickly learn how three heads put together can achieve far more mischief than one. It&#39;s all a matter of being one step ahead of them, but this is harder than ever imaginable, especially when they are joined by a little brother. Gill soon realises that her poor academic record could be the down fall in this most complex part of her education, as she struggles to study for &#39;A Masters in Motherhood,&#39; awarded from the &#39;University of Life.&#39; With Gill and Eddie&#39;s involvement in the equine world and love of the countryside, the triplets have a free, fun and varied early few years, which the story follows." />
