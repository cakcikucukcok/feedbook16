  <title>Struck Down, but Not Destroyed - Melvin J. McCaster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This autobiography Struck Down, but Not Destroyed is a vintage narrative of a struggling African American man who is committed to make something out of himself -- without blaming America for his problems along the way. This is a story of a hard working, courageous man of faith who persisted, at times against great odds, to affirm that even life in the rural South or the Northern ghetto can have integrity. 
This is an unpretentious attempt to celebrate small victories for those who are often in this world considered the least of these. These many unheralded stalwarts of faith have made solid contributions; and yet have survived numerous close calls! 
The sixteen chapters with helpful descriptive captions unfold in the chronological sequence of Brother McCasters life events against the background, doubts, and scares of his extended family and others associated with him.
One cannot miss Reverend McCasters uncanny and profound sense of joy as it resounds throughout this exceptional testimony about the rewards for those who persist in the faith of our humble yet most inspiring forebears." />
