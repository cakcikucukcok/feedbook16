  <title>Thinking Hell Was on Earth - Slim Hasson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="!! IT&#39;S A BLESSING TO BE TAUGHT BY THE MASTER TEACHER!!
Dear Lord I thank you for my writing ministry. On August 28th 1985 the Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth spoke to my heart and told me to use what I had. He carried my mind back to the many victories I had accomplished in writing letters. I was in Morning Prayer at the church I attend, and I was asking the Lord for an answer to a situation that I was in. The Lord&#39;s answer was simple. He said use what you have. In the early part of the year 1986 God gave me a title, He said to me, It&#39;s A Blessing to Be Taught by the Master Teacher. It was on a Sunday Morning I was getting ready for church. I thought it was going to be the title of a song, and that the Lord would give me the words at a later date. Then in September that same year the Lord let me know that I was to do a great work under that title. Through my writing ministry I will say the things that the Master Teacher puts on my heart. Just in case I have not made it plain who the Master Teacher is, his name is Jesus Christ of Nazareth." />
