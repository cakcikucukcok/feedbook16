  <title>Autobiography of a Repaired Physician - Prospero Shimshon Shimon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Autobiography of a Repaired Physician : Mental Health as Seen from Both Sides
of the Desk is a trilogy. Book I deals with my life before, during and after the emergence of
an attack of bipolar disorder. The shattering consequences of the disorder and the personal
history that precede it are discussed in great clinical and personal detail. My chief concern is
that the reader comprehend how the past, present, and future come into play in understanding
the outcome in the treatment of this destructive and deadly disease.
Book II concerns the social stigma associated with having a history of the disorder and
the many pitfalls clinically, psychologically and socially that exist for an individual, such as
myself who is charged with the professional responsibility of caring for people suffering from
similar affl ictions.
Book III is about my adventures in the real world as I have seen it. It relates to the
madness of our world in which the ever present and infuriating search for power prestige and
possessions appear unfortunately to be the primary determinants of behavior in our society.
Many of my closest friends have tried to dissuade me from writing about this issue
because they feared I would be exposing myself to further social stigma. I feel strongly that
those who have suffered from the destructive effects of the spectrum of bipolar disorder must
know how treatment works and what pitfalls to avoid in treatment. As a physician it is my
duty to heal myself and with the help of some very talented colleagues. I have been able to do
just that. My struggle continues and in that sense more books will be written.
I would like to especially acknowledge the help of my wife Barbara, who has stuck with
me through thick and thin, and my children Miranda, Alexander and Victoria who love each
other and me." />
