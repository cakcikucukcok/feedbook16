  <title>Are British Police Institutionally Racist? - Shujaat Husain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Read about the real time saga of this Pakistan-born former Police officer who was tracked down as an international con-man by three British Police forces operating in tandem, arrested, locked up and charged with criminal deception - all for simply applying for jobs with them! Author Shujaat Husain, a double Honours graduate from the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US (where he was  a scholarship pupil in the 1970s), was harassed and defamed by at least 12 uniformed officers (ranging in rank from Chief Superintendent to PC) from across these forces for nearly two years , and then for another five by their legal teams as he fought for justice singlehandedly  - and  won - in the British Tribunals.
Husain, in his memoirs, has brought about a scathing indictment of the institutional racism prevalent in the British Police and, to a limited extent, even in sections of the British Judiciary. This is a must-read given the Police culture of the present time.
Husain currently lives in South London with his two grown up daughters and works as a tutor and examiner for several A Level subjects." />
