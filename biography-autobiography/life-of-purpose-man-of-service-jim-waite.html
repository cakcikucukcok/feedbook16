  <title>Life of Purpose, Man of Service - Jim Waite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Facing insurmountable odds of survival on a destroyer caught in a 100 foot typhoon in the South Pacific  during World War II, Life of Purpose, Man of Service tells the story of a man, who not only survived, but thrived. Cecil Erwin Waite learned first- hand how take difficult, unbearable situations and turn them into blessings. When their first-born child wasnt expected to live through the night, they prayed. Through their faith, their young son also became a survivor and continues to thrive to this day.  As he faced obstacles throughout his life, Erwin learned at a young age that things worthwhile dont come easily. He also found that in midst of trials and tribulations, there was always a greater power from above whom he could always rely on during lifes deepest, darkest moments when all would seem lost. He knew his life had purpose and that serving others made that purpose that much greater." />
