This is the true life story of one man&#39;s journey, wrought full of bad decisions and the real life consequences that were the result. A journey that began innocent enough; but that, over time, spiraled out of control to the point of complete hopelessness and a very bleak outlook for any meaningful future.
When the author came to realize that; with belief in a power greater than himself; and that he could learn to make better and more thoughtful decisions; that it was possible for a different way of life and a more promising future.
Overcoming self imposed mental, emotional and spiritual obstacles, brought about a challenging, hopeful and much more productive lifestyle. Facing and working to clean up the wreckage of his past, has help to restore hope for him and the family, that he was estranged from for nearly twenty years. It also gave him a second chance at a family life, where he is now regarded as Silly Papa." />
