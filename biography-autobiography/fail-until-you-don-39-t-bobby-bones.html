  <title>Fail Until You Don&#39;t - Bobby Bones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The #1&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;bestselling author of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Bare Bones&lt;/em&gt;, host of the marquee morning program&amp;#160;&amp;#8220;The Bobby Bones Show,&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;comedian and dedicated philanthropist&amp;#160;delivers an inspirational and humorous collection of stories about his biggest misses in life and how he turned them into lessons and wins.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bobby Bones is the youngest inductee ever into the National Radio Hall of Fame alongside legends Dick Clark, Larry King, and Howard Stern. As &quot;the most powerful man in country music&quot; (&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;),&amp;#160;he has reached&amp;#160;the peak of his profession and achieved his childhood dreams. Each weekday morning, more than&amp;#160;five&amp;#160;million fans tune in to his radio show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Bobby reveals, a lot of what made him able to achieve his goals were mistakes, awkward moments, and embarrassing situations&amp;#8212;lemons that he turned into lemonade through hard work and humility.&amp;#160;In this eye-opening book, he&amp;#8217;ll include ideas and motivations for finding success even when seemingly surrounded by impossible odds or tough failures. He also includes anecdotes from some of his famous friends&amp;#8212;Andy Roddick, Chris Stapleton, Charlamagne Tha God, Charles Esten, Brooklyn Decker, Walker Hayes and Asa Hutchinson&amp;#8212;who open up about their own missteps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bobby&amp;#8217;s mantra is Fight. Grind. Repeat. A man who refuses to give up, he sees failure as something to learn from&amp;#8212;and the recollections in this funny, smart book, full of Bobby&amp;#8217;s brand of self-effacing humor, show how he&amp;#8217;s become such a beloved goofball.&lt;/p&gt;" />
