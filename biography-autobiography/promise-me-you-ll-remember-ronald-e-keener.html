  <title>Promise Me You’Ll Remember - Ronald E. Keener</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Linda Simanella Keener&lt;/b&gt; loved puppies, maybe even just a little more than people, but she did love them both. She had a Sicilian father John and a German mother Martha, and she favored her fathers Italian side of the family. Her father taught her how to play the flute and they performed duets together. In &lt;I&gt;Promise Me Youll Remember,&lt;/I&gt; author Ronald E. Keener offers a memoir of Lindas life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months after Lindas death from cancer when she was sixty-seven years old, Keener began this remembrance of his wife. He shares a host of highlights from his life, her life, and their life together, a relationship of thirty-seven years. &lt;I&gt;Promise Me Youll Remember&lt;/I&gt; narrates how Linda loved to laugh, had a deep sense of humor, and delivered her own one-liners. A person of charm, style, and taste who hailed from the heartland of Springfield, Illinois, Linda also had the common touch, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with insights about marriage and relationships, life and living, and death and dying, &lt;I&gt;Promise Me Youll Remember&lt;/I&gt; pays tribute to Linda Keener and the mark she left on the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
