  <title>Love &amp; Laughter - Marilyn R. Moody</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Love &amp; Laughter is the true story of the original American Online Cancer Survivors Support Group. It was written to show the bonding between many courageous people, who came together weekly, in cyberspace to share their stories while going through their cancer experiences. The title of the book is the essence of the story. You may become teary eyed in places, and for sure you will have many good laughs as these people bring lots of humor to the sessions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The story is told in a two act play, with two scenes each. The period covered is from Halloween of 1994 through New Years Eve of 1995. There are some main characters, and also people who drop in on occasion to participate in the cancer chat meetings. You will probably find at least one person that you cant help falling in love with. If you are a cancer survivor you will probably relate to what these people are experiencing and expressing in the group.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When the play was performed in Southern California it received excellent reviews. People who never had cancer, spoke about how much they learned about a cancer diagnosis. Its informative, sad, funny and very, very real.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Comments from audience members who had never touched a computer but who said theyd read about chat rooms in the newspapers stated, that it gave them such a vision of what goes on in one that they now could understand what chat rooms are about.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One person who lives in the Midwest ordered a copy of the video tape of the play. Shes not a cancer survivor and has never been in a chat room, but she said watching the play made her feel like she was part of the group.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you read the book you will probably wonder how cyberspace could be created on a stage... but just let your imagination go with the story thats what I did when I wrote it. Youll know whats going on, and well Welcome to Cancer Survivors!&lt;/P&gt;" />
