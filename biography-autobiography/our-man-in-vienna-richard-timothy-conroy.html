  <title>Our Man in Vienna - Richard Timothy Conroy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The wit and charm that marked Our Man in Belize enlivens Richard Timothy Conroy&#39;s new &quot;diplomatic memoir,&quot; in a posting that couldn&#39;t have a more different location.  But the wheels of lower-level diplomacy, it turns out, turn at the same rate whatever the setting.  Plucked from the cost of Central America and put down in post-World-War II Vienna, land of Der Rosencavalier and whipped cream cakes, Conroy still was &quot;not mentioned in dispatches&quot; (or at least, not complimentary ones) but even a lowly vice-consul could do some good in people&#39;s lives.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, his effort to help a woman flee Vienna after she reported that someone was sneaking into her room and slicing off a bit of her foot each night.  Or the unfortunate Austrian whose visa application had been rejected three previous times, with no explanation.  Conroy discovered that there was a picture of the man in a Red Army sergeant&#39;s uniform.  Turned out the man had conned a gullible Red Army soldier to lend him the uniform for a snapshot, and an equally gullible group of Russian border guards that he was an undercover Red agent posing as (what he really was) an export-import businessman. Nobody before Conroy had bothered to ask for an explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In between similar tales of deep diplomatic deed and misdeed, the author gives his readers an imitable take on the Vienna of those days.  Want to buy a second-hand piano?  Some inexpensive paintings?  How about -- above all -- that famous Viennese food and beer?  You could have found it there with Conroy as your guide; failing that, his account of those days is just as rewarding and not nearly as fattening.&lt;/p&gt;" />
