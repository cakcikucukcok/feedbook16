  <title>Go Rockets!: Life Lessons from Minor Hockey - Stephen Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Minor sports and organized activities are an important part of growing up and learning life lessons-and it was no different for Stephen Moore as a youngster in Prince Edward Island.   Although his early exploits in minor hockey were not the success he dreamed of he got a second chance to truly enjoy the adventure-as a parent living vicariously through his children.   From the beginning of his youngest son&#39;s training to skating evaluations and multiple minor hockey seasons, Moore shares hilarious observations translated into life lessons that can be applied to many different situations.   Although set in the context of minor hockey, this story explores how to help your child build life skills by being engaged in any organized sport or activity.  Relive your own memories or prepare yourself to give children the tools to learn, fail, and succeed-and laugh out loud at the outrageous adventures of players, team staff, and parents progressing through years of minor hockey with Go Rockets!" />
