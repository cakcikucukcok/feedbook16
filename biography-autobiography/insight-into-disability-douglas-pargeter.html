  <title>Insight into Disability - Douglas Pargeter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;More people than you may realize suffer from the effects of schizophrenia, and there is no cure for this mental illness. &lt;i&gt;In Insight into Disability&lt;/i&gt;, author Doug Pargeter candidly reveals his battle with schizophrenia: how he learned to cope with the symptoms and gain control of his life through treatment, proper medication, and his devotion to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, Pargeter shares his life story: growing up as one of five children in Seattle, Washington; serving in the air force; attending college; being married and having children; battling cancer; and living with schizophrenia. &lt;i&gt;Insight into Disability&lt;/i&gt; provides a firsthand look at how mental illness affects all aspects of a personal life, such as maintaining relationships and being employed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Meant to inspire, &lt;i&gt;Insight into Disability&lt;/i&gt; shares Pargeters successes, breakthroughs, and triumphs over adversity. It communicates how his gift for writing song lyrics, which are interspersed throughout the book, contributes to his healing within. He describes how his relationship with God saved his life and how he became a changed man through his treatment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
