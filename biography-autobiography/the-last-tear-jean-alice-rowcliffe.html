  <title>The Last Tear - Jean Alice Rowcliffe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a MUST READ for anyone who has lost a loved one or is seeking an honest story about what it is like to traverse the journey of grief. Jean&#39;s powerfully candid story is rich, insightful, and illuminates a truth in all our lives that is sadly unnoticed and often silenced.  
Juli Fraga, Psy.D., Licensed Psychologist
A mother grasps her dying sons hand, struggling how to let go and aghast at what life will become after his death. The Last Tear is the harrowing true story of my only child James, a dynamic 17 year old who was diagnosed in 2008 with an extremely rare form of cancer, dying eleven months later on the eve of Mothers Day. Rather than allowing cancer to define his days James became even more focused on school, college applications and his future, inspiring not only his peers but the larger community including President Obama. My crippling sorrow that paralyzed for years is shared with candor and will touch anyone who has struggled with excruciating grief. Poignant and at times difficult, The Last Tear eventually uplifts as it transcends a tale of cancer and death to embrace the larger canvas of how to live authentically with sorrow as a new companion." />
