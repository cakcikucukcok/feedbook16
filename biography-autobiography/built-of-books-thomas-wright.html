  <title>Built of Books - Thomas Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An entirely new kind of biography, &lt;i&gt;Built of Books&lt;/i&gt; explores the mind and personality of Oscar Wilde through his taste in books&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intimate account of Oscar Wilde&#39;s life and writings is richer, livelier, and more personal than any book available about the brilliant writer, revealing a man who built himself out of books. His library was his reality, the source of so much that was vital to his life. A reader first, his readerly encounters, out of all of life&#39;s pursuits, are seen to be as significant as his most important relationships with friends, family, or lovers. Wilde&#39;s library, which Thomas Wright spent twenty years reading, provides the intellectual (and emotional) climate at the core of this deeply engaging portrait. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the book&#39;s happiest surprises is the story of the author&#39;s adventure reading Wilde&#39;s library. Reminiscent of Jorge Luis Borges&#39;s fictional hero who enters Cervantes&#39;s mind by saturating himself in the culture of sixteenth-century Spain, Wright employs Wilde as his own Virgilian guide to world literature. We come to understand how reading can be an extremely sensual experience, producing a physical as well as a spiritual delight.&lt;/p&gt;" />
