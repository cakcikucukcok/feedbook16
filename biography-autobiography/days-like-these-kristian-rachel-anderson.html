  <title>Days Like These - Kristian &amp; Rachel Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;There are love stories and then there&#39;s &lt;EM&gt;Days Like These&lt;/EM&gt;—the story of Kristian and Rachel Anderson.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When Kristian wanted to show his wife, Rachel, how much he loved her after learning he was terminally ill, he ended up winning a million hearts around the world, thanks to the now famous YouTube video he made for her 35th birthday. This heartfelt and moving tribute by a young Australian father of two and his battle with cancer drew attention to a much larger story—an ordeal so many families face alone.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Like Oprah, who invited Kristian and Rachel on her show, and Hugh Jackman, who helped make one of Kristian&#39;s dreams come true by appearing on the tribute, though we didn&#39;t know him, we were so inspired by him we felt like we did.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;He touched lives, gave hope, and left behind a precious legacy that will mean a longer and better quality of life for thousands of cancer sufferers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;His story, told in his own words from his blog entries, with additions from his beloved Rachel, will inspire you to know that even in your darkest moments, the light can shine through.&lt;/P&gt;" />
