  <title>Spontaneous Human Combustion - Liv Dietrich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Divorced Christian womans somewhat successful life suddenly resembles an exploding fireworks factory! The white hot explosions spontaneously begin happening inside her innermost being. What is happening in her life to transform her into a woman who doesnt want to stay asleep because she might miss something? What does God want her to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous Human Combustion is filled with the intimate details of the emotional story, as well as the spontaneously written songs. Some of the music is written, or you can be inspired to make up your own music to go with her lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noted author, Liv Dietrich, is proud to announce winning the Writers Clueless Award for her latest book, Spontaneous Human Combustion. She is qualified to give the award because she created it! Since Dietrich doesnt remember writing any of the lyrics, she remains intrigued and mystified by reading her own new book over and over again. Everyones name, including the authors, is changed to protect the guilty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
