  <title>Anne Sexton - Arthur Furst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Striking photos of the alluring, defiant, and mesmerizing poet Anne Sexton-many published for the first time in this exclusive collection-taken during the last summer of her life, before her suicide on October 4, 1974&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to those who knew her best, Anne Sexton was always preparing for her death, almost like an Egyptian queen constructing her pyramid. She wanted to create the most poignant version of her life story, which would best serve as her monument after she was gone. She left behind a study filled with her papers, writings, and photographs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a photo assignment from Houghton Mifflin, Arthur Furst first met Anne Sexton in April 1974, just two months after she was revived (against her wishes) from a suicide attempt. Welcoming him into her life as a friend, Sexton entrusted Arthur Furst to capture her image over the last months of her life. Undoubtedly, she intended his photographs to become part of her legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anne Sexton: The Last Summer&lt;/i&gt; beautifully juxtaposes Furst&#39;s exclusive photos with letters and unpublished drafts of Sexton&#39;s poems written during the last months of her life, as well as previously unpublished letters to her daughters, giving unprecedented insight into the life of this legendary poet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
