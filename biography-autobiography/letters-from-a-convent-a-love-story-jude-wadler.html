  <title>Letters from a Convent: A Love Story - Jude Wadler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1962, 18, LIVING IN A CONVENT&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; What was I thinking? What am I doing here? I&#39;m in a convent! Have you ever looked up and seen where you were and what you were doing, as if this were not you?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; In 1962, at the age of 18, I entered the convent of the Sisters of the Divine Savior. Severely restricted as to whom I could write, I secretly composed an extended letter - more of a diary, really - to my best friend Irene.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &quot;The lights are out and I&#39;m in the coatroom, writing. I feel like going home - just packing and leaving.&quot; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; After six intense months, I did. Forty-five years later, I was shocked when Irene sent me the long-forgotten document, a vivid portrait of adolescence in that special time and place.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This is no expose, no attack on the Catholic Church or its traditions, but an intimate look at life behind the walls of a convent. And, of course there is a boy, Harry - the object of my romantic fantasies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &quot;I have decided - I&#39;m going to be a nun. I have been waiting to see if I would be strong enough. But if I want to, I can. And I know God wants me to - and I want to do His will - and so this is my life. Sorta sad in a way, isn&#39;t it?&quot;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Please join me on my remarkable journey." />
