  <title>I Want to Be a Teacher - Cathine Gilchrist Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone knows that educators should be competent and well qualified, but what about caring for the students?&lt;p&gt;
In life, when the boss cares about employees, they are more productive, and Cathine Gilchrist Scott, Ph.D., knows that the same is true in the classroom.&lt;p&gt;
She looks back at her career as an educator, from her first job to earning her doctorate of philosophy degree to sharing lessons learned from teaching students of all ages at home and abroad. Throughout the book, you will learn how to:&lt;p&gt;
	encourage, motivate, and inspire students to be successful;
plan, implement, and evaluate lessons;
	change your attitude to believe that all children can learn;
	overcome the fear of teaching; and
	assess student learning in positive ways.&lt;p&gt;
If teachers teach, but less than 50 percent of the students make passing grades, then the teachers have not taught at all. They think they have taught, but they have not done their jobsand this book seeks to fix that problem.&lt;p&gt;
Filled with real-life anecdotes, revealing insights about great educators, and opinions, this resource delivers a no-nonsense account on what it takes to truly succeed as an educator." />
