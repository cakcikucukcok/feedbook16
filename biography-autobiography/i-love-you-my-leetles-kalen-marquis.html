  <title>I Love You My Leetles - Kalen Marquis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I Love You My Leetles&quot; is a simple but heartfelt rhyming narrative poem that captures the loving bond shared between a brother and sister growing up in a single parent family. It also exemplifies the precious gift of a shared lifetime that siblings so often share. Usually predeceased by parents and outlived by children and grandchildren, brothers and sisters share the same life trajectory. Even if they go their separate ways and travel their own life&#39;s path, they have shared understandings and experiences from their earliest and most formative years--potentially extending from cradle to grave.    This autobiographical poem was originally written almost twenty years ago but has been updated and renewed in celebration of Leetle&#39;s 40th birthday. With last year&#39;s passing of their selfless mother and the precious bond the author continues to share with his still precious adult sister, amazing husband, and their two amazing children, this story remains as poignant as ever." />
