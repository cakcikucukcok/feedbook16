  <title>Changed at the Altar - Andre Nero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was birthed from a reality show &amp;ldquo;To Find Love&amp;rdquo; rejection after producers were more interested in my true story being a movie verses having the network look bad for casting me because of the X on my back. I knew I was on to something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My life spun out of control when my high school sweetheart of 6 years, stood me up at the altar only to find out that she married another guy the same day. He was a Pastor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led me to prison, homelessness, robbing Peter to pay Paul, caretaker for my mom and getting less than ideal jobs. I had even resorted to becoming a male entertainer, Bouncer &amp;amp; Strip Club DJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My turning point was stopping an armed robbery and winning a NAACP Image Award as &amp;quot;Hometown Champion&amp;quot; from Radio One. The robber was #1 on Crime stoppers list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go with me on my life long MADE FOR TV journey as I continue my quest for LOVE! I assure you that it&amp;rsquo;ll make your head spin and encourage you at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
