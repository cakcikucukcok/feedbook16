  <title>The Gatherer - Sfc Tammy J. Goodwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When my mother and stepfather signed me up to join the army at the age of seventeen, I don&#39;t really remember my reaction.  I do remember that I had no idea what the army was.  I had never been more than ten miles up or down the road, and that was mostly from riding the school bus.  My life at that time consisted of books.  If the paper had words on it, then it was in my hands.  I loved stories.  I loved the way the story would allow me to feel the emotion of the experience coming off the paper.  For example, my seven-year-old nephew asked me one day, &quot;Do you want to see my imagination?&quot; I instantly said, &quot;Yes, yes I would.&quot;  Through the years, the army provided the opportunity to experience different cultures and meet some amazing people. I invite you to turn the page, and as you read, use your imagination to see and feel my experiences, starting with my second deployment to Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;" />
