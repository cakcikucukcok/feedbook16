  <title>More Than Mama Sees or Daddy Knows - Rhonda B. Haugabook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I am still the girl from the neighborhood of people who kept the candle of hope burning brightly inside their hearts and, through love and patience, passed that light on to all of us youths. Elders refused to allow forced segregation to be the determinant for the quality of their life experiences because they knew the true Supplier of all riches.  Holding their memories close within me, I joyfully resolve to continue to have pride in my ancestry and allow my life and art to re?ect their Wisdom. Now the mature, virtuous woman of John Miles and Estella, I appreciate the patience and Wisdom shared by so many during the days of small steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Nsaa; a living, breathing, bursting-with-love, genuine woman who understands and appreciates the rich, earthen soil of experience that has expanded my heart and authenticated my character.  I daily adorn my psyche with my own self-made garment of silk and purplea garment that holds me fast to my spirituality and maintains my uniqueness and originality. My attainment of the ideal is to completely mesh with that virtuous woman pro?le expressed so expertly by King Lemuels mom and lived so joyfully by my Estella.  I am forever indebted to wise King Solomon for introducing me to so much Wisdom, as well as my beloved John Miles, Estella, and a host of others who have helped make Wisdom my friend.  With a heart of true gratitude, I stand proud and con?dent that Wisdom is guiding me to become that ?awless brightly shining ruby that mirrors the heart of my Creator.  A ruby that forever radiates forth its true translucenceno matter what unknown situation life may send my way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
