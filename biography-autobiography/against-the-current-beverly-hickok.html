  <title>Against the Current - Beverly Hickok</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Against the Current,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; set in the 1940s, is the
story of how a young woman, Jan, comes to
acknowledge and accept her lesbianism and
find a place for herself in the world. Jan first
begins to explore gay life while a student at the
University of California at Berkeley. Jan had
expected to earn a teaching credential after
graduation, but once the war broke out decided
to leave school to become a riveter for the war
effort, then to join the Navy. After the war she
returns to the university on the G.I. Bill,
entering library school. She steadfastly holds on
to her dream of one day finding a woman with
whom to settle down and share her life.
There are very few books available which
realistically describe lesbian life in the early
40s, long before Stonewall. Descriptive and
passionate, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Against the Current&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vividly evokes
the sights, sounds and flavors of the era. This
book is not to be missed!" />
