  <title>A Gift from Julie - Judith Drummond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was written to encourage people facing a life-threatening illness, in the case of the author, nonalcohol cirrhosis of the liver. One of my doctors said, If you dont get a liver transplant soon, you are going to die. What a statement to hear from your doctor! This doctor, who is a caring and compassionate person, referred me to the Liver Center at Lahey Clinic in Massachusetts. As I found out, getting a new liver is not quick, and definitely not easy. The power of prayer is evident throughout this entire crisis. Judy received many blessings and miracles throughout this grueling journey. I was told I had Factor 5, which is a blood clotting problem, therefore I could not have a live donor liver. This meant I had to wait and pray a cadaver liver could be found before I would die from liver disease. Through prayers, blessings, and miracles, the doctors said they would do a live-donor liver transplant. My niece became my liver donor after having difficulty finding a donor. If you have ever been thrust into a life threatening situation, this book will interest you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
