  <title>The Trials &amp; Triumphs of a Regimental Commander During World War Ii - Colonel Thomas A. Glass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a memoir by Colonel Thomas A. Glass of his military training and experiences prior to, during and after World War II.  It is a very personal account which details what army life was like for a young officer and his wife.   As a very junior second lieutenant he served as supply officer and transportation officer for the harbor defenses of Honolulu.  In 1940, he reported to the just activated 21st Engineer Aviation Regiment, the first regiment dealing specifically with aviation in the Corps of Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1942 he activated and took command of the 816th Engineer Aviation Battalion which built a heavy bomber base at Gosfield in Essex, England.  In August of 1943 he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed 925th Engineer Aviation Regiment which built heavy bomber bases, air depots and other air facilities in England.  The 925th Engineer Aviation Regiment served in Normandy and in the middle of July of 1944, was assigned the mission of supporting and providing the necessary airfield facilities for the XIX Tactical Air Command, the air arm of General Patton&#39;s 3rd Army.  Except for brief periods in Germany when the 925th was temporarily attached to 1st   Army and 7th Army,  the 925th remained with 3rd Army.  The 925th built the first airfield across the Rhine River at Eudenbach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the war Colonel Glass served in the Engineers Office, U. S. Headquarters Army Air Force in the Pentagon.  He studied major heavy earth moving equipment companies, and then became Chief, Procurement Division, Office Chief of Engineers, U.S. Army.  He transferred to the Air Force and supervised the move of  MATS (Military Air Transport Service) to Andrews Air Force Base.  The book concludes with his resignation from the Air Force in 1949 caused by the conflict of career and family.&lt;/p&gt;
