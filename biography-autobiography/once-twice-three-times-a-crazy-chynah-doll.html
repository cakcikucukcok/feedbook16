I am so tired of this whole scene right now. Are you going to tell her who I really am or do I need to tell her myself? Demarco instantly fell silent, his eyes big as saucers as he looked pleadingly at Jeremy. Hearing Jeremys nasally voice and seeing his suddenly magnified feminine gestures really woke me up with a jolt. Whatever denial I had been experiencing the last few minutes was now gone. I was immediately very aware of the situation that was before me. I looked at Jeremy, then Demarco. I felt my chest start to tighten and my breathing became short and sporadic. I started to back away from them both saying, Nooooo, noooo this cant be, this is not happening! As I repeatedly shook my head no, I could feel the tears falling down my face. I screamed at Demarco, You lied! You lied to me! I asked you if you were gay. You swore to me that you werent,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Georgia&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial&quot;&gt; I can&#39;t believe this is happening&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Cambria&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Instead of my dream man I got a down-low gay man, a cocaine-addicted famous rapper and a psycho maniac stalker. Yes, you read right. I know that there are other women out there who can relate because they may have experienced at least one of these situations. It is very rare and next to impossible to find a woman who has gone through all three situations, but I did. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Georgia&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;This is the true story of my life with these three men.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Arial&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Cambria&#39;,&#39;serif&#39;; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;As you read my autobiographical memoir you will see that due to bad judgment, bad decisions and loving the wrong man time and time again my life has had many mind-blowing and incredulous episodes.
