  <title>Yes, Sir! No, Sir! No Excuse, Sir! - Robert George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book chronicles a patriotic American boy on the difficult journey to manhood. During high school, he walked away from faith and in college survived the rigorous discipline of The Citadel. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as an Air Force officer spending a year at war, where the loss of close friends, duplicitous politicians and the chaos in America left him angry, disillusioned and confrontive to authority. Newly married, he became a Los Angeles policeman where untreated PTSD left him divorced and depressed eight years later. Each season of life is illustrated with pithy stories from a myriad of life experiences and flawed choices which ultimately led to the brink of suicide. Thankfully, the story doesn&#39;t end there." />
