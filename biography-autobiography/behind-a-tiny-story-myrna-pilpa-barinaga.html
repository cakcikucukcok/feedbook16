  <title>Behind a Tiny Story - Myrna Pilpa Barinaga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What started as a tiny story triggered memories of a lifetime. This is a story of a familys struggle and survival of the brutal Japanese-American War. 
I was one of eight children in that family, walking for days through the jungle for safety and living on prayers. Thankfully, the war ended with all of us in the family alive and together.
Marriage and childbearing brought four children, two with very special needs. Searching for help led us to come to America.
I did not intend to make my obstacles and struggles in life the focus of my story. However, I would like to direct the reader to the power of faith and prayer and the strength and perseverance derived from allowing God to guide and lead me in my lifes journey.
With all that life has offered me, my heart, awaking, cries, May Jesus Christ be praised!
When Morning Gilds the Skies
When morning gilds the skies, my heart awaking cries,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Alike at work and prayer, to Jesus I repair,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
(German hymn c. 1800, translated by Edward Caswall, 18141878)" />
