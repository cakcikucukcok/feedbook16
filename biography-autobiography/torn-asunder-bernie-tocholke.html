  <title>Torn Asunder - Bernie Tocholke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a very detailed experience of what it was like within a certain cult. The author reveals many incidents and situations that he experienced or witnessed while being a member of it for several years. He gives descriptive details on the child abuse, the cult&#39;s practices, their beliefs, and how marriages like his own, get destroyed by their ministry. His purpose for writing this book is to inform, protect, and prevent the reader of this book from making the same mistake that he was trapped with. Upon reading this book, the reader will get an insight which creates nearly an immunity against the cult&#39;s schemes of entrapment. The author&#39;s desire is that he wishes that someone else could have given him a book like this before he became ensnared by their tactics. If the horrors of abuse and death mentioned in this book has already been experienced by the reader, they have already fallen prey and became a victim of the cult. The majority of the contents of this book, is behind the scenes and secret from a casual visitor or general public spectator. Some contents are shocking!
