  <title>Jefferson Davis&#39;s Generals - Gabor S. Boritt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Confederate General P.G.T.Beauregard once wrote that &quot;no people ever warred for independence with more relative advantages than the Confederates.&quot;  If there was any doubt as to what Beauregard sought to imply, he later to chose to spell it out: the failure of the Confederacy lay with the Confederate president Jefferson Davis. In Jefferson Davis&#39; Generals, a team of the nation&#39;s most distinguished Civil War historians present fascinating examinations of the men who led the Confederacy through our nation&#39;s bloodiest conflict, focusing in particular on Jefferson Davis&#39; relationships with five key generals who held independent commands: Joseph E. Johnston, Robert E. Lee, P.G.T. Beauregard, Braxton Bragg, and John Bell Hood.  Craig Symonds examines the underlying implications of a withering trust between Johnston and his friend Jefferson Davis.  And was there really harmony between Davis and Robert E. Lee?  A tenuous harmony at best, according to Emory Thomas. Michael Parrish explores how Beauregard and Davis worked through a deep and mutual loathing, while  Steven E. Woodworth and Herman Hattaway make contrasting evaluations of the competence of Generals Braxton Bragg and John Bell Hood. Taking a different angle on Davis&#39; ill-fated commanders, Lesley Gordon probes the private side of war through the roles of the generals&#39; wives, and Harold Holzer investigates public perceptions of the Confederate leadership through printed images created by artists of the day. Pulitzer Prize-winner James M. McPherson&#39;s final chapter ties the individual essays together and offers a new perspective on Confederate strategy as a whole. Jefferson Davis&#39; Generals provides stimulating new insights into one of the most vociferously debated topics in Civil War history." />
