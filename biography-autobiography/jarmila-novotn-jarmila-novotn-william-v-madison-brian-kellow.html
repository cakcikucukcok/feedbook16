  <title>Jarmila Novotná - Jarmila Novotná, William V. Madison, Brian Kellow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;A legendary beauty, hailed as one of the greatest singing actors of her time, Jarmila Novotná (1907--1994) was an internationally known opera soprano from the former Czechoslovakia. Best known for her performances in  &lt;I&gt;Der Rosenkavalier, The Marriage of Figaro,&lt;/I&gt; and  &lt;I&gt;La&lt;/I&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Traviata, she was a celebrated performer at the Metropolitan Opera and other theaters across Europe and the United States. A &quot;natural screen actress,&quot; Novotná also appeared in Hollywood hits such as The Search&lt;/I&gt; (1948) with Montgomery Clift (with whom she shared an enduring friendship) and  &lt;I&gt;The Great Caruso&lt;/I&gt; (1951) with Mario Lanza. She was also considered a pioneering &quot;crossover&quot; star who performed on Broadway, and worked in radio and television with Bing Crosby and Abbott and Costello. This gifted artist captivated audiences worldwide, and while she was still a young woman, the Czech government treated her as a national heroine and its cultural ambassador.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In  &lt;I&gt;Jarmila Novotná: My Life in Song, &lt;/I&gt;editor William V. Madison brings Novotná&#39;s own English-language version of her best-selling memoir to readers for the first time. The memoir details how, following her debut in 1925 at the National Theater in Prague, her fame quickly evolved into a tremendous musical career at a time of unprecedented political upheaval. Novotná provides eyewitness accounts of the Nazi takeovers of Germany and Austria, the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, and the aftermath of the Velvet Revolution in 1989, as well as her extensive travels in the United States during and after World War II.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Throughout the memoir, lavishly illustrated with photos from her personal collection, Novotná shares entertaining stories about her time in Hollywood, an &quot;unending stream of parties&quot; -- including those hosted by Louis B. Mayer, co-founder of MGM Studios -- alongside such stars as Jimmy Stewart and Elizabeth Taylor. Novotná also offers revealing profiles of many notable artistic figures of the time, including director Max Reinhardt, composer Cole Porter, and conductor Arturo Toscanini, and dignitaries such as Dwight Eisenhower and Tomá? Garrigue Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia. This fascinating self-portrait offers a window on history and the reflections of a captivating and supremely talented figure who left an indelible mark on the performing arts.&lt;/P&gt;" />
