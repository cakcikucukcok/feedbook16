  <title>Life In Its Rawest Form - Qiana S Hicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An inspiring true story of how far hope in the heart of a young, abused, and disadvantaged child can take her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Qiana - a young girl whose body and soul are battered by abuse, neglect, and abandonment. She grows up in an environment impoverished by drug- and alcohol-addicted parents. She dreams of and hopes for a better life, wishing she could morph into a life of pure peace and happiness. But extenuating circumstances throughout her childhood and young adulthood prevent her from enjoying that life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the adversity and oppression she and her siblings frequently endure keep that nostalgic dream tucked away in a far-off place. This young Qiana often wonders why she was born into these circumstances, and why others, perhaps more deserving of such circumstances, were not. She questions whether God is punishing her for being born. She has a hard time understanding why anyone, especially a child, must endure so much pain and hardship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily life for Qiana was a constant worry. She worried about her own and her siblings&amp;rsquo; well-being and safety. She worried about how to keep her mother from getting high or intoxicated. There simply was no room left in her world to experience the joys of just being a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the young girl is separated from her family and placed in foster homes, group homes, and shelters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she becomes a mother at the age of 15, her hopes for a brighter future diminish somewhat, yet she continues to believe that future will be possible. Her journey is riddled with struggles. Nothing comes easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qiana understands that in order to have a better outcome for the future, she has to think differently. Among her toughest challenges are not allowing her mother&amp;rsquo;s addictions and poor choices to affect her own choices, and not following in her mother&amp;rsquo;s footsteps and those of others around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a sliver of hope, with cuts, bruises, and a wounded spirit, Qiana is fiercely determined to persevere in conquering her past and to exceed society&amp;rsquo;s expectations. Her misfortunes inspire her to forge a better future. Though not a single day is easy as she pursues her dream, she never stops dreaming, and she never gives up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She perseveres, scars from the past being the only real help she has. Somehow, she figures out how to use her scars and experiences as opportunities for the future she&amp;rsquo;s dreamed of for so long. Regardless of the odds, Qiana relentlessly searches for the future of her dreams. She works tirelessly, she overcomes old obstacles&amp;mdash;and, early on, she achieves success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qiana&amp;rsquo;s marvelous story of hope, inspiration, determination, and her tested formula for success can help others who want to beat their own odds&amp;mdash;regardless of what has come before&amp;mdash;to triumph over the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quotes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t give up or look back, because no one else had my back. The more I understood that, the more I pushed myself to work harder each day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As overwhelming as it could sometimes be, failure was not an option.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Regardless of how dark the past may have been, there is always hope for a brighter future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
