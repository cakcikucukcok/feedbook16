  <title>Life Love Loss - Deborah DeMatthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Mother who&#39;s life that came crashing down around her in a blink of an eye!!!  A Mother&#39;s Worst Nightmare....How does a Mother continue to go on living her everyday life, when her beloved son Joseph, was ripped right out of her heart and life.........         
                                                         My Life With My Son
                                        Nothing is Stronger than a Mother&#39;s Love     
I cannot believe when I look up at you, and see a beautiful man that use to be my little boy. 
I am always in awe, when I see the changes in you, but yet it saddens me because that part of 
my life is over. Yet all  the memories that I have, will still bring all the laughter, and this 
warmness in my heart, and I will always have tears in my eyes. Since you where a baby up until 
present time, you have always given me so much joy, and so many gifts, that I cannot even 
count. I dont think you ever realized all the ones you gave me that where from within. We 
made so many memories together, but the love you gave me, was something so special it will 
last a lifetime." />
