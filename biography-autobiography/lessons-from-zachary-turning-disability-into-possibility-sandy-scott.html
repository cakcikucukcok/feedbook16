  <title>Lessons from Zachary: Turning Disability into Possibility - Sandy Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sandy Scott had it all: a beautiful country home, a successful husband, and the freedom to be a stay-at-home&amp;nbsp;mom. Then the news crashed down on her like a Tsunami: her infant son Zachary not only had&amp;nbsp;severe brain damage but probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t live past his first birthday. As denial gave way to despair and&amp;nbsp;grief, Sandy looked out over the new, strange world into which her family suddenly found themselves&amp;nbsp;thrown and wondered if they would ever know happiness again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it was in the very challenges that Zachary&amp;rsquo;s condition presented to her that she discovered her own&amp;nbsp;hidden inner resources and a whole new level of compassion among other people. She eventually took on&amp;nbsp;greater roles in the disability community and found her calling as a life coach.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Lessons from Zachary, Sandy shares the knowledge and insights she gained through her own personal&amp;nbsp;journey of discovery and overcoming obstacles, showing us how to use our strengths to navigate life&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;difficult situations to find meaning and lasting fulfillment. Scattered throughout her moving story are&amp;nbsp;multiple useful tools from life coaching&amp;mdash;Life Wheel, checklists, Miracle Question, and others&amp;mdash;to help us&amp;nbsp;develop our unknown potential.&lt;/p&gt;" />
