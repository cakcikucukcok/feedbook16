  <title>Breath to Consciousness - Sistar Julia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This novella passes on knowledge as a reminder to be a conscious being. The memoir begins with a catalyst that possessed me on my soul journey. It happened at a Bob Marley and The Wailers reggae concert in Sydney, Australia, in 1979, when I was fifteen. The hypnotic music, lyrics, Rastafarian culture, and herbs of wisdom had the effect of heightening my states of consciousness. This powerful experience led me to explore. 
In order to try to understand this force I had to go back to my roots, my family history. I began to examine and place pieces of my life together like a jigsaw puzzle. I took a physical outward journey in a time when there was no instant society. I traveled to the Caribbean and beyond, where I encountered and reasoned with Rastafarians. Simultaneously, I discovered I was on an inward spiritual journey that was growing in strength through biblical and metaphysical readings. I was transforming my existence and my way of lifemetamorphism. 
As an enlightened spirit in the fleshnow with a child to rearI had to share this wisdom. I had discovered the essence of faith, and I endeavored to not get caught up in the Babylonian system and the cycles of a routine life. The grass isnt always greener on the other sideit just may be a bit different.
This is a thought provoking and deeply personal story." />
