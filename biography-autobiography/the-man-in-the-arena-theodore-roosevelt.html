  <title>The Man in the Arena - Theodore Roosevelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first compilation of selections from the major works of Teddy Roosevelt since the resurgence in his popularity due to the major award-winning/bestselling biographies by Edmond Morris and H. W. Brands&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time he was twenty-five the future president of the United States was already a published author. From &lt;i&gt;The Naval War of 1812&lt;/i&gt; through his four-volume  &lt;i&gt;Winning of the West&lt;/i&gt;, Teddy Roosevelt proved himself a master historian...but one must not make the mistake of labeling him a stodgy academic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future president was also a great outdoorsman, with such works as &lt;i&gt;Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;African Game Trails&lt;/i&gt; capturing his rough and ready lifestyle. Theodore Roosevelt was part Francis Parkman, part Lowell Thomas, and one hundred percent spirit of America and master of the printed page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Man in the Arena&lt;/i&gt; collects self-contained excerpts from some of his greatest works, including such revealing memoirs as &lt;i&gt;The Rough Riders&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;Autobiography&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Through the Brazilian Wilderness&lt;/i&gt;, in an effort to capture the many aspects of a great American who was indeed larger than life and his own best &quot;Boswell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This collection of his writings gives credence to Henry Adams&#39;s assertion that Roosevelt was &quot;pure Act&quot;: there was, it seems, no subject (or foe) he was afraid to tackle. &quot; - &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
