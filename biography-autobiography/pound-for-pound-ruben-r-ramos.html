  <title>Pound for Pound - Ruben R. Ramos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is a semi-biographical account of an everyday mans life in a
different country attempting to support his family. Arnold
Ramirez, husband and father of two, has left the Philippines
in search of a better way of life for his family. Arriving in
England, his straight forward, often spontaneous approach
to business earns him as many enemies as friends. Arnold
refuses to be bullied, intimidated or belittled by this different
culture. Arnold gives his unique perspective on each of
his workplace. From the fast paced, back stabbing world as
salesman, to the fast paced, back stabbing world as waiter.
Behind the scenes, it is Arnold who is in charge of those
around. It portrays his ambition to be better than the situation
he is given. Fighting as much as he struggles, giving as
good as he is put down and striving to create
his own unique place within a business,
for money and for values." />
