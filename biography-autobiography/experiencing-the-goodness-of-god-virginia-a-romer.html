  <title>Experiencing the Goodness of God - Virginia A. Romer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Do you have personal goals in mind and see your present situation as a hindrance to achieving them? Are you struggling with finances, relationships and forgiveness? Faith and trust in God may be the answer to your concerns. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;At the completion of high school, it was my dream to attend college. Having no money, I realized that I had to do something to make my dream a reality. In this book, I share how I made a start toward achieving my first dream by getting a job and then watching numerous doors open. Learn from my personal experiences the goodness of God and how He saved me from death and opened doors, enabling a single mother to obtain a college education and provide for her son. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;It is my hope that the readers, particularly adolescents, will find this book useful in dealing with life&#39;s problems and issues, and realize the importance of perseverance while allowing God to work things out in their lives. As for adults, I hope they will be strengthened in their determination, focus, fortitude, understanding and forgiveness, and learn to lean on God to help them through the hard times.&lt;/P&gt;
