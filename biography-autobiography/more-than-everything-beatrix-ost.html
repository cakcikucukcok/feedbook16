  <title>More Than Everything - Beatrix Ost</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#147;Beatrix uses words like she uses paint. . .with brush strokes so vivid and rich I feel as if I&amp;#8217;m there watching as her story unfolds. I love this book!&amp;#8221; &amp;#150;Sissy Spacek&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beatrix Ost&amp;#8217;s memoir of her artistic awakening and early marriage opens on the heels of Germany&amp;#8217;s recovery from the self-imposed disasters of World War II. She is part of the new generation that dances disobediently in the bombed-out villas and underground jazz caverns of Munich. Beatrix rides the dynamic decade up through the world of art, fashion, and cinema into the revolution of politics and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriage to the self-made prodigy and archaeologist, Ferdinand, impresario of the Hot Club, draws her into the mystical realm of the ancient Mexican gods. Soon, two sons are born. They make an odyssey through Mexico where, under the wing of the artistic elite, their homes full of Riveras and Kahlos, the initial impression is intoxicating. But the further they press inland, the more Ferdinand loses himself in his obsession and addictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ost draws us into the vortex of human craving to portray the complexities of her early marriage to a man scarred by the war, climbing the magical mountain of his own desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accompanied by the author&amp;#8217;s artwork and photographs from her private collection, Ost &amp;#147;&amp;#133;shakes free of an impossibly dark life as the wife of an alcoholic&amp;#133;brushes off the stardust of romance and, stepping back in the light, comes into her own.&amp;#8221; (Barbara Epler, President, New Directions Publishing)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
