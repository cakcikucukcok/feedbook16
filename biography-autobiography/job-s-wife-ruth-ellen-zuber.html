  <title>Job’S Wife - Ruth Ellen Zuber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Her husband is sitting in the ash heap, scraping his diseased body with a piece of pottery. Her children have been killed, along with most of the servants. The animals are either dead or stolen. Where has her life gone? Yesterday, she was the wife of one of the most affluent men in the east. Now her life is shattered and possibly threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will she survive? She is afraid, but where will she go? Should she tell others how she is feeling? Would they understand? She is alone and desperately wants her old life back. How can she go on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt like that? Life can change in a moment, and what you know to be reality today may only be a memory tomorrow. Ruth Ellen weaves her personal story along with an imaginary Jobs wife. Together they will bring you through any adversity you may face with an understanding that God is sovereign and in control even when everything seems to be spinning out of control.&lt;/p&gt;" />
