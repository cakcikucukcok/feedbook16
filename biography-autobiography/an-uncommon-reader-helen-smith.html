Known for his incisive criticism and unwavering conviction in matters of taste, Garnett was responsible for identifying and nurturing the talents of a generation of the greatest writers in the English language, from Joseph Conrad to John Galsworthy, Henry Green to Edward Thomas, T. E. Lawrence to D. H. Lawrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;An Uncommon Reader&lt;/i&gt;, Helen Smith brings to life Garnett&#39;s intimate and at times stormy relationships with those writers. (&quot;I have always suffered a little from a sense of injustice at your hands,&quot; Galsworthy complained in a letter.) All turned to Garnett for advice and guidance at critical moments in their careers, and their letters and diaries--in which Garnett often features as a feared but deeply admired protagonist--tell us not only about their creative processes, but also about their hopes and fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond his connections to some of the greatest minds in literary history, we also come to know Edward as the husband of Constance Garnett--the prolific translator responsible for introducingTolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov to an English language readership--and as the father of David &quot;Bunny&quot; Garnett, who would make a name for himself as a writer and publisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Edward Garnett occupies a unique position in the literary history of our age,&quot; E. M. Forster wrote. &quot;He has done more than any living writer to discover and encourage the genius of other writers, and he has done it without any desire for personal prestige.&quot; An absorbing and masterfully researched portrait of a man who was a defining influence on the modern literary landscape, &lt;i&gt;An Uncommon &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reader&lt;/i&gt; asks us to consider the multifaceted meaning of literary genius.&lt;/p&gt;" />
