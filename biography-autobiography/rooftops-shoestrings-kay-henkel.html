  <title>Rooftops &amp; Shoestrings - Kay Henkel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When arriving in Rio, the position and the company had collapsed. Without any knowledge of the Portuguese language, no personal or business connections or prospects for employment, we were immediately destitute. We were ejected from our hotel with only the clothes we wore. For a time, we lived secretly in an office building which was illegal to be in after dark. What food we ate was pilfered off of left over plates at outdoor cafes, or taken from a storage closet full of canned sardines from the importers office whose floor we slept on. After many months we were offered work at a bug infested English Yacht across the bay from Rio. At last we had a bed and food! The description of our lives with unbelievable challenges sufficed our love... (Humorously written) Eventually we were offered remedial work in the Brazilian Interior (Jungle) Life in the Interior, and the incredible adventures. All kept in a diary, became worthy of writing this book." />
