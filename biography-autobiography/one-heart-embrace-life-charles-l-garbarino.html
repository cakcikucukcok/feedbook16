  <title>One Heart—Embrace Life - Charles L. Garbarino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his memoir, One HeartEmbrace Life, author Dr. Charles Garbarino recounts his journey of recovery and rebirth following open-heart surgery.  He reveals his innermost thoughts and feelings, from his reaction to receiving the unexpected news that he required cardiac bypass surgery to his subsequent depression and suicidal thoughts. He openly wonders why God gave him this burden to carry, but finally decides not to just survive his heart attack but to embrace life and live it to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Heart&lt;/i&gt; also recounts the experiences of others, from people who have had cardiac setbacks to those who have lost loved ones in catastrophic natural disasters, to our military troops who have given the ultimate sacrifice. This memoir is about life and its many components, focusing primarily on the heart, both emotionally and physically. Its underlying theme is to embrace life by understanding how to move ahead when challenges cross your pathwhether youre facing the loss of a child or the discovery of a medical crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One HeartEmbrace Life&lt;/i&gt; celebrates the many facets of life and the importance of a life well lived. It follows Dr. Garbarino through each step along the path to recovery and includes contributions from health and religious professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons are priceless. The journey is like no other. Get ready for a book that will change the way you look at things, forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All proceeds of &lt;i&gt;One Heart  Embrace Life&lt;/i&gt; will benefit the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;" />
