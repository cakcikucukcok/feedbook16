  <title>I Am Woman - Victoria Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; The Womens Feminist Movement (Women&#39;s Lib) started in the western world in the 1800&#39;s and has gone through three waves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The &#39;first&#39; wave was in the 1800&#39;s, and was orientated around the stations of middle or upper class women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The &#39;second&#39; wave began in the 1960&#39;s. It addressed unofficial inequalities, sexuality, and perhaps the most controversially, &quot;reproductive rights.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The &#39;third&#39; wave started in the 1980&#39;s and continues through the present. &lt;/p&gt;
It focused on embracing contradictions, conflict and irrationality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I AM WOMAN --The Book, is the &#39;fourth&#39; wave in the Feminist Movement. It is the final wave : the Tsunami Wave! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The book, like the women&#39;s organization, will help quide women to empowerment and transformation. It is for women seeking to re-invent themselves, and becoming the beautiful butterfly they really are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I AM WOMAN will finally re-unite men and women, and women can now stand tall and proudly say : &quot;I AM WOMAN&quot;....Watch me soar! &lt;/p&gt;" />
