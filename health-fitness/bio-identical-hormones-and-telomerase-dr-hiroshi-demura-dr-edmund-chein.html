  <title>Bio-Identical Hormones and Telomerase - Dr. Hiroshi Demura, Dr. Edmund Chein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As we grow older, many of us experience a tremendous amount of frustration because something inside us doesnt work the way it used to. Nutrition experts tell us to eat certain kinds of food  some claim free radicals are the sole cause of aging, and that the only way to longevity is through antioxidant supplements. Fitness gurus tell us the only answer is exercise. When we do exercise or go on a diet, we feel a little betterbut not much, and not the way we felt when we were younger. We exercise or diet twice as much to stay at the same place, and even that is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story has been the same throughout history, so we wonder if we should continue to fight the battle, or if we should just learn to grow old gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvements in medical technology and new knowledge about exercise, nutrition, and rest are all part of the solution to remaining young and healthy. However, we continue to see some people who do not take particularly good care of themselves, yet are aging more gentlyand we know instinctively that parts of the anti-aging puzzle must still be missing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
