      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Art Of Feeling Good&lt;/i&gt; unveils se Yoga, a self-healing practice that transcends our obstacles and transforms our lives. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;African American women in the United States and the Diaspora share a unique history, which has affected how we feel about ourselves. Something happen, yet we dont talk about it. But, even if we choose not to deal with the chaos of the past, the suffering of our foremothers will not fade away. Knowing the history is not enough. Healing from the enslavement process is crucial to connecting with our beauty and feeling good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Art of Feeling Good&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Robbin Alston takes us on a journey to the balancing power of se Yoga. As a guide, this book encourages African American women to begin embracing and re-claiming yoga as practice for healing. Using our ancient mystical systems, knowing who we are, reconnecting with a universal holistic spirit-mind-body energy practice, with se Yoga, we begin to re-member, to re-discover our real identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Alston introduces the balancing power of se Yoga, a blend of personal energy, healing asanas, healthy lifestyles, breath connection, rhythmic movements and guided meditations designed to activate our vital energy centers, rebalance our life force and engender authentic relationships with self and others &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its time to feel good. &lt;i&gt;The Art of Feeling Good&lt;/i&gt; offers a path to wellness, right relationships and mindful choices. This book shares with you an empowering healing process that supports your journey toward self-realization and feeling good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
