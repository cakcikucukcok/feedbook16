  <title>The Girl Who Held Her Dandelion High - Jasz Kaur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gurmeher, a talented and lively young girl truly was a free spirited child with the deep-set eyes of a wolf, soul of an owl and winged spirit of a Garuda bird. The clear sky was her domain.
She chose to see beyond that which was shown to her by society. She knew she was never cut from the same loincloth as the rest of the comrades and never desired to be the same. She was destined to BE and DO something Extraordinary with her life. She wanted to be her own unique gemstone.
She beat many odds physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually through her exponential journey of REBRANDING, by being her own artisan. Join her as she shares her escapades and the realizations she learnt on the importance of self-actualization, the power of prayer and manifestation as well as the 5Ps she held on tight through this learning phase. She pruned through wealth of self-improvement information and created her own recipe of abundant happiness with techniques and a mental attitude that resonated with her.
Her take-home message is;
Ones definition of oneself evolves as one embraces the concept of being a student of life. It sheds the hard shell called ego and embraces serendipity.
