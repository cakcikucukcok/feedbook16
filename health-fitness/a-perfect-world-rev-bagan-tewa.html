  <title>A Perfect World - Rev. Bagan Tewa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is why he said, Let the weak say they are strong. Keep saying it and you will become it and you will have no choice but to release it because power and strength never stays within.
A ruler and a scale are two different forms of measurement. The scale is used to create balance with the thoughts and with the ruler you measure everything else. You can measure the life and not the thoughts because the thoughts have no ending. But the mans life, you can measure it, because there is an end to his life.
There is no position that you are stuck in until you die. As a matter of fact, you get out of life just what you put in. We are all Gods children.
Talking about your fear with other people is the best thing you can do. It does not matter how ridiculous the fears in your mind sound.
Ponder this: I think greed discovered man, rather than man discovered greed.
There are many reasons why I think most men feel that women should not run the world. Firstly, their own insecurity, secondly, their thirst for greed, thirdly selfishness, but most of all is that fear inside that women do the same to them that they did to females in the past.
Being a slave to your own fear is one of the most deadly things in life, it prevents you from achieving your dreams, it is sometimes worse than alcohol or drugs." />
