  <title>Black Out - M.T. Shumaker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While helping a woman who has overcome many obstacles in life, I learned a lot about myself. I met a lifelong friend, discovered the true meaning of life, and discovered that everyone has a purpose. This woman, who spent years battling addiction and abuse and grieving the loss of loved ones, called me for help. Then she spent time in psychiatric hospitals only to be told she had a mental illness.
She wanted to share with me that with faith, anything is possible. I have worked very closely with her over the past few years. She has shared her private journals with me, as well as conversations she had with her therapist, and we learned a lot about one another.
Today she has realized that alcohol, poor choices, and not being true to herself prevented her from having a so-called normal life. She has developed true relationships with people she considers lifelong friends and would like them to know she loves and respects them deeply. To the people she has harmed in her drunkenness and addiction, she asks their forgiveness. We would both like the reader to know that this book was not written to cause harm or offend anyone." />
