  <title>Doctor, Teach Me to Parent - Allan G. Hedberg Ph. D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The information provided by Dr. Hedberg in this book is excellent for parents as their childrens first teacher. The book also provides helpful guidelines for educators offering parenting education to their families.  Al Sanchez, Retired Principal, Educational Consultant, parent of three mature children. 
Dr. Hedberg presents a thoughtful recipe for healthy family living.  He begins with a candid assessment of desirable ingredients; adds generous portions of practical training for parents in managing issues that happen in most families; in developing leader qualities in children; and even practical guidelines for the wise use of the internet.  Let it simmer in your mind and heart, and enjoy the feast.  Dean M. Johnson, D. Min. Retired, Former Minister and International Family Care Consultant, Trails, British Colombia, Canada, parent of five mature children.
Parenting is like being on a journey and not knowing where the next corner will be, how high the next hill will be and how deep the next valley will be.  Dr. Hedberg helps equip parents with goals that are practical and lessons that effectively give direction.  He 
addresses behavior patterns that cause negative influences and helps identify personality problems.  You will learn to equip your children to eventually leave home with a healthy emotional and spiritual confidence while building their self-esteem.   Ron Hendricks, CGPP, Director of Planned Giving, Trinity Western University, Langley, British Colombia, Canada, parent of three mature children.
Dr. Hedberg provides understandable parenting advice in an easy to read book. The Ask the Teacher section in each chapter provides practical questions to integrate a childs home and school life.  Joaquin Partida, Clovis, CA, Teacher of the Year, 2008, parent of two mature children." />
