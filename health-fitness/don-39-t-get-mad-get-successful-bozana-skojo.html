  <title>Don&#39;t Get Mad, Get Successful - Bozana Skojo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;One day, one of Bozana&#39;s Skojo&#39;s friends told her she was &#39;a good poor&#39;. Bewildered by the words at first, Bozana gradually came to realize they really did describe her - someone who was never overcome by adversity, but who fixed up her hair, put on a little lipstick and her &#39;game face&#39; to work her way out of any difficulties that fate tossed her way. She realized it was a strategy for living that could apply to any situation.
In Don&#39;t Get Mad, Get Successful, Bozana shares stories from her life and talks about how she did overcome the difficulties, the ups and downs - the loss of a parent, professional, and personal betrayals - to emerge as a successful business owner and loving mother of a wonderful son. Her story illustrates a host of practical life lessons." />
