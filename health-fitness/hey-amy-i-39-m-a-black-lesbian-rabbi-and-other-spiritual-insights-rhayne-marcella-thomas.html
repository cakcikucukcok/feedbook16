  <title>Hey Amy! I&#39;m a Black Lesbian Rabbi!!! &quot;And Other Spiritual Insights...&quot; - Rhayne Marcella Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This gem has made it&#39;s mark with a catchy title that makes you curious enough to open its pages. Once inside, you instantly realize this book has absolutely nothing to do with the title and everything to do with making your daily events of life more enjoyable. Rhayne has exposed her personal life&#39;s journey with all the pain, struggles, internal battles and seemingly impossible obstacles so you can see that life can be very challenging. Then she adds light moments and humor to prove you can overcome all things as long as you don&#39;t give up or give in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow her as she takes you on a ride through many stumbles, achievements, animal metaphors and teary eyed wake up calls. As soon as you are ready to feel sorrow for her, you are struck with enlightenment as she opens the door of unconditional FAITH! It is at this point when you realize that you, too, can conquer your obstacles, enjoy each and every moment, live your dreams and be the person you really want to be. BUT...only if you really want it. GOD Bless &amp; Safe Keeping!&lt;/p&gt;" />
