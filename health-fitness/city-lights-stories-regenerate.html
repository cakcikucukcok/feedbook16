  <title>City Lights Stories - Regenerate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You are holding a collection of stories, the aim of this collection is to equip and inspire you to make a positive impact in your own community, through relationships and creative initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this material, you will read about Dave and Will who developed gardens on wasteland in inner city London council estates, encouraging residents to be part of the process of renewal and creativity by growing plants and vegetables. Will hosts community harvest feasts, bringing together local residents to eat their own locally-grown produce. Andy in his 20s, started a lunch club for isolated elderly people, rallying his student friends to help serve homemade meals in a borrowed church hall. Pauline responded to a news bulletin about the lack of housing for refugees and asylum seekers, by setting up homes across North London to provide safe housing. Annie set up
regular meals in her church building for homeless people and rough sleepers. Mark started a football club for local lads from an estate in London, most of whom were from extremely difficult backgrounds and not in education or employment. Countless others have weeded gardens for families referred by social services, mentored children in foster care and painted a wall in a refuge. Abroad, Mick and Ruby moved into an inner city slum community in the heart of Manilla for 9 years with their young children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of City Lights are stories and friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
