  <title>Nothing Is 100 Percent - Courtney Metrich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I had just turned twenty-one and was in my senior year of college when I was diagnosed with grade four brain cancer. The doctors gave me less than a year to live. I fought, and fought, and I fought hard for eleven years. I am still alive and living independently eighteen years later.
I&#39;m currently in my sixteenth year of teaching elementary school and plan on doing so for a long time. I attend Chicago&#39;s Cancer Survivor&#39;s Walk and Celebration every spring so I always remember how many of us have survived this difficult battle.
I hate hearing about others who have been diagnosed with cancer. I wish I could just reach into the television and tell them all that I have been through and learned. That it is possible to beat this fight even when the doctors tell us otherwise. So this is my way of reaching out to you and your loved ones. This book is filled with everything I didthe traditional therapies as well as all of the alternative therapies I used.
This is an inspirational story about my fight against cancer. A story filled with hope, perseverance, and miracles." />
