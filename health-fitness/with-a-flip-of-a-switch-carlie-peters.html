  <title>With a Flip of a Switch - Carlie Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Forty-eight year old Carlie Peters had just begun her new life living in San Francisco when she
met Dick in the summer of 1994. They fell madly in love with one another. Even though Dick was much younger, the age difference didnt seem to matter to either of them. Their love was stronger than they had ever felt before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October 2008, the charmed life they had shared together for over 14 years would change forever. Dick began working with a woman that would literally brainwash him and change the man Carlie loved into someone completely unrecognizable. Her fun-loving sweet, gentle husband had now become a mean, nasty, egotistical, bitter soul. What follows is her story of betrayal, abandonment, and a newfound strength to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a flip of a switch and no explanation whatsoever, Dick decided he didnt want to be
married any longer. Heartbroken and feeling alone and scared, Carlies story takes us through her journey of fear, heartache, and insecurity as she wonders how to live without the man she loved so deeply. Starting over at her age was not going to be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the extraordinary love and support she finds from her family and closest friends, she
takes us through how she handles the fear of starting a new life and the strength she draws
from her journey, a journey filled with unexpected revelations and even humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;It is Carlies hope that others who have had
similar experiences to hers will also draw
strength and insight from her story.&lt;/center&gt;" />
