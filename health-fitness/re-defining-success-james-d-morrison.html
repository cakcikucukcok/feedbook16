  <title>Re-Defining Success: - James D Morrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is just like walking through the rainwhether you dance through it (and have fun) or just try to avoid the puddlesyou still get wet.  Your life has a God-authored plan that can be exciting or can be drudgeryit all depends on how you choose to see each circumstance in your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day, you can be surrounded by circumstances that test who you say you are.  Those are circumstances that test your character.  Circumstances like financial hardship, failed relationships, unexpected opportunities, unplanned success, or a blow to your self-esteem.  Circumstances as trivial as an argument with your spouse, or as difficult as an argument with your spouse.  You might think that God has deserted you when you have difficult circumstances in life, but you can find that He is closer than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Re-Defining Success: Finding New Hope&lt;/i&gt; lets you know that you aren&#39;t the only one who has fouled up in some aspect of life and that you can come out of the situation that you are in stronger and smarter than you were yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of wondering about your future, take this opportunity to step out in faith and begin to learn Gods plan for you.  As you make a new start in your life, you have the chance to make changes in the person you are and to live in the plan He has for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Re-Defining Success: Finding New Hope&lt;/i&gt; can help you see a larger picture for your life and be encouraged that these circumstances are life-challenges which have a reason.&lt;/p&gt;" />
