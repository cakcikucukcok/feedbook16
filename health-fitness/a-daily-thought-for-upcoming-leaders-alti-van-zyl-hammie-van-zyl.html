  <title>A Daily Thought for Upcoming Leaders - Alti van Zyl, Hammie van Zyl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Leadership has very little to do with what you do, but has everything to do with who you are. God told us to raise end-time leaders for His army. What does an end-time leader look like?
	End-time leaders never steal the spotlight, but lead without drawing attention to themselves. 
	They teach others to live in the supernatural as if it is the natural, and introduce others to the God of the impossible.
	They model a lifestyle of trust in Gods faithfulness. 
	But mostly, a great end-time leader leads by serving others, pouring him or herself out in service of King Jesus and His bride. 
By reading only one thought daily and pondering on it, you will allow God through His Spirit to change you into an end-time leader in His army." />
