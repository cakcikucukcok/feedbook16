  <title>Mind over Matter - Susan Whykes Ma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Performance Anxiety can affect most musicians at one time or another. Pre-performance butterflies in the tummy may be unpleasant but they can give an important edge to a performance. Some players hover around the fringes of anxiety, but it is when we cannot make the switch from anxiety to excitement that the problems begin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not your fault that you get very nervous before performing to others. It is the natural way your brain programmes its information. By changing that information in the unconscious mind you will be able to make the switch so that you are calm and in control next time you perform. By using the techniques in this book, you will learn to relax and take things as if they are completely routine. You will develop new ways of thinking and behaving that will guarantee your success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whilst this book is aimed at the adult performer, there are some thoughts included for the younger pupils to learn how to keep calm and relaxed before any big events.&lt;/p&gt;" />
