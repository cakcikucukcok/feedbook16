  <title>Wild - Ralph OSB Wright, Kevin Nickolai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is WILD... a children&amp;#39;s book?  Well, yes, of course, but no...not exactly.  Much of the humor will be way beyond the kids.  Is it a humor book for adults?  Well...maybe in an Aliceinwonderland or Doctorseussian kind of way.  Is it for adolescents?  Most certainly!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They&amp;#39;ll probably remember their earlier A thru Z books and see it as partly a parody of and partly a rejoicing in the child&amp;#39;s fresh new view of the inhabitants of our &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot; world.  The truth is that WILD... is all these things and more.  It is the joy and surprise of childhood blended with the wit, wisdom and&amp;ndash;yes&amp;ndash;the touch of cynicism of the person who has long trod the planet and knows its ways.  It is both satire and innocence, beauty and ugliness, horror and delight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is Grimm&amp;#39;s Fairy Tales and the Wild Life Encyclopedia.  It is Jack in the Beanstalk and Brave New World.  It is Australia, Tokyo, New York and London.  In the WILD... alphabet, you will find Antelope through Zygote, and then, just when you think you are finished, you&amp;#39;ll find more WILD with Puffins and Rhinos, Camels and Boas...and more.  You will enjoy this book if you enjoy fish, animals and birds, but especially if you enjoy poking fun at the strange ways of the creatures on our planet, beginning, of course, always with yourself." />
