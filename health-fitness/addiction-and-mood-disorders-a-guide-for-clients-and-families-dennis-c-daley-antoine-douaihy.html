  <title>Addiction and Mood Disorders:  A Guide for Clients and Families - Dennis C. Daley, Antoine Douaihy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Millions of individuals diagnosed with severe mental illness also suffer from an equally powerful substance use disorder.  If you or someone you love has been diagnosed with dual disorders, this book can help. Addiction and Mood Disorders: A Guide for Clients and Families is designed primarily to educate individuals with dual disorders and their families about mood and addictive use disorders.  It not only gives a message of hope, but also provides practical suggestions on ways to manage these disorders.  The author provides guidelines and strategies for recovery from dual disorders based on, and adapted from various treatments that have proven effective for addiction, mood disorders, or both.  This book is filled with case examples that show growth and positive change, as well as the difficulties many individuals struggling with a dual diagnosis face.  Advocating a recovery model in which the affected individual takes responsibility for getting the most out of professional treatment and self-help programs, this book shows that being an active participant is the key to getting the most out of your recovery. This book is for use not only by those individuals who suffer from addiction and mental illness, but also by their family, friends, and other members of their support system. Professionals who work with these individuals will find this book to be a useful guide in their clinical work as well." />
