  <title>PATCHED WANGS - Amanda Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this book, Amanda takes you on her journey and shows you step by step how she was able to kick a 17-year drug/alcohol addiction and bounce back when no one believed in her. She now lives a happy, vibrant life and wants the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, she thought she had it all under control, but one night, Amanda came face to face with reality when she found herself standing alone in an unfamiliar place without knowing how she had gotten there. Everyone who knew her predicted she would end up in prison or 6 feet under. She&amp;rsquo;d already been arrested 4 times and had spent 2 months in a traditional recovery center, but nothing had worked to get her sober for any length of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she started using Meth, her life went into a drastic downward spiral. In a short period of time, she lost EVERYTHING, including her daughter. She didn&amp;rsquo;t feel she had anything to live for anymore, but there was still one tiny spark inside her that she couldn&amp;rsquo;t ignore. This was God speaking to her, telling her it was time to make some serious changes, and she listened. She packed up and moved to another state, leaving everyone behind, not knowing where she was going to live or what was about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the bend in the road is super important so that the sight of what&amp;rsquo;s ahead doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop us dead in our tracks. On August 10, 2015 Amanda decided to lay down the drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and Coca-Cola. She faced many obstacles and adversities on her journey to sobriety. Her car was repossessed and she was evicted, leaving her homeless in a city where she had no identifiable help. During those trying days, the only way she made it through was by staying connected to God, her purpose in this world, and the love she received from her new environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad circumstances can bring amazing blessings and lessons if you&amp;rsquo;re open to receive them. By going through all of that, Amanda came up with the C.O.N.N.E.C.T. method. It got her sober and kept her sober and now she wants to share it with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how much life has bruised you, no matter how broken you feel, no matter how many names people have called you, YOU DESERVE HAPPINESS just as much as anyone else in this world. These principles can work for anyone, so read this book and turn your life around, too!&lt;/p&gt;" />
