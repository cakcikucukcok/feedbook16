  <title>Abusive and Drama bundle - Lindsey Kensington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This bundle contains sad topics that confront us with the harsh realities of our society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might know someone who is in a relationship with someone who is emotionally abusive, or you might be in a relationship with someone like that yourself. Or perhaps you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to recognize it and are curious how you can recognize the signs. Whichever the reason, you have come to the right place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since it is all over the media and the horrific stories echo through our empathetic ears, it is almost mandatory for any caring civilian in society to understand at least some basics when it comes to sexual abuse. The facts are out there, and it is really happening to people in secret and sometimes without hiding anything. In this book, you will learn to grasp the reality of this sad phenomenon in society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Some of us may have been through it, and others have seen it in other people&amp;rsquo;s homes. Domestic violence is a serious problem. The stats don&amp;rsquo;t lie, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t completely accurate either. They reveal the victims who speak up, but not the ones who stay silent. If you are wondering what is involved in domestic violence, what to do, and how to recognize it, then you&amp;rsquo;ve come to the right place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In one part of the book, there is a study with the specific issues that relate to suicidal tendencies. Causes and consequences come to light, and comparisons are made between countries, individuals, and triggers that influence a person in a depressive state to contemplate the unthinkable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps not as severe, but verbal abuse happens all the time. Whenever people are mean to each other, they are, in some small degree, abusing another with their words. It could be strangers, coworkers, bosses, your spouse, your parents, your boyfriend or girlfriend, or your friends." />
