  <title>Where Success Lies - Rhona Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;~I started writing with a need to take action to resolve certain social issues that I and others have faced. It is my intension to get people talking while I present positive solutions to certain social issues by writing books that have a plausible storyline allowing the reader to put himself in that situation. It is my goal to go from book to screen using the media as a forum to discuss those changes as I dramatize it in the backdrop of a mental movie. An example of this is Where Success Lies The book is written with true life experiences. It is a storyline that people will talk about because its something people can relate to and likewise a story that will go from book to screen on demand. While it is not my design and will never be my intension to draw sympathizers, I most certainly write in a fashion that challenges the reader to see himself in the setting thereby causing the reader to ask and then later answer the question: What would you do? Drawing him out and into the picture so no matter who he is, he will be able to experience my story just as if it had happened to himself. Its a story that will entertain all adult people men and women alike because who doesnt like to win? Who doesnt revel in what prevents the bad from taking place? Who does not triumph when one finally escapes from what is eating him up or cause the thing of value to become safe again? So while the story may only address a specific group of people, Im confident that anyone drawn to read a book with good content written in a spirit embodied as a plausible storyline would be compelled to read Where Success Lies ~&lt;/p&gt;
~When a young Black woman discovers she is barred from procuring property, she is forced to take the course of clever schemes. She wrangles herself into one of the most prestigious positions on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that resulted in the change of corporate law through the Fortune 500 advertising media in order to get where success lies.~" />
