  <title>The Luckiest Man Alive - Stephen R. Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is the culmination of a dream, a family and a journey.
The dream continued over three consecutive nights during and after a flight to Australia. Steve and his wife had changed flights in Hong Kong where they purchased some Melatonin tablets to help avaoid jet lag. Steve then slept from Hong Kong to Adelaide and the dream started. It continued over the next two nights whilst sleeping i the home of their great friend Marion just North of Adelaide.
The family in the dream is Steve&#39;s real family as the dream had woven them all into the story. The other - French - family is pure dream. However Steve&#39;s wife is a doctor and they do both work in the NHS. Steve&#39;s brother did die too early at the age of 57. His Sister and her husband have raised money and built a school in Uganda and his younger brother is completing the conversion of a barn to the South West of Limoges. Steve has two children and one adorable grand daughter. His daughter has been looking at the geneology of the family and his son is a computer nerd whilst also being the family adventurer.
The journey was to visit his brother near Limoges where he fell in love with the area and &#39;discovered&#39; the Chateau that he had seen in the dream - smaller than he remembered but hey that&#39;s dreams for you." />
