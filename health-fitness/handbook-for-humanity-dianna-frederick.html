  <title>Handbook for Humanity - Dianna Frederick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Handbook for Humanity provides you with the resources needed to discover who you are and how to release emotional reactions from your everyday living, bring happiness and love to you and live a good life. From understanding unseen forces to listening to your inner voice, this handbook offers techniques, instructions and insight to help you recognize and use these specific resources and assimilate them into your human being.&lt;br /&gt;
It teaches what separates you from your wisdom and gives you the instructions, tools and forces to find your fulfillment. Take it in and absorb this wisdom. Attract and integrate the missing parts of you.&lt;br /&gt;
The wisdom and power you are looking for is inside. This handbook is written for every person living or who will be living on this planet. It is written for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dianna Fredericks Handbook for Humanity offers a fresh and elegantly beautiful look into the spirit and soul of why we are really here on earth. Having known Dianna for twenty years, I have seen firsthand her inner growth and spiritual awareness. She is living proof of the power of directly connecting to God and all of the blessings that are bestowed upon ones life. I highly recommend this guide; it will save your life!&lt;br /&gt;
