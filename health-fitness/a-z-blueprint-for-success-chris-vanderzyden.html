  <title>A-Z Blueprint for Success - Chris Vanderzyden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every time I open a motivational book I want to be inspired. A-Z Blueprint for Success did so in a simple, constructive, and unique way. I know I&#39;ll implement some of Chriss ideas in both my professional and personal life immediately.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Williams, VP/GM ESPN Cleveland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A-Z Blueprint for Success is one of the most exciting books of its kind in years. It is packed with powerful concepts, fantastic tips and tricks, and essential information. Chris Vanderzydens view is completely fresh, enlivening, and a must-read for all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Gray, author of Pocket Idiots Guide to Performance Appraisal Phrases&lt;br /&gt;
and Beyond the Resume &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris challenges us to break the shackles of a reactionary, spiraling existence to be transformed into a content, productive, and balanced being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul M. Heinze, president, Paul M. Heinze Company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all want to elevate our lives and A-Z is a wonderful blueprint to guide us to take action and build successful businesses and enhance our lives. A wonderful book for all readers  young and old!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen DeNatale, president, DeNatale &amp; Associates, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A persons character thrives when three domains of growth and development are in balance: body, mind and spirit. Care for your body; exercise and feed it well. Stretch your mind and reflect on what you learn. Strengthen your spirit and nurture your soul. Keep things in balance and you will be ready to succeed where life plays outin your work and in your relationships. Vanderzyden found herself in a distressingly out-of-balance condition, reflected on its staggering cost and took action. She has reflected on her personal crisis and brought those insights to bear on her work and personal life. In this book, she has organized that hard-won wisdom and serves it up for your consideration in chapters that are bite-sized and stand on their own. Its a provocative read.&lt;/p&gt;
