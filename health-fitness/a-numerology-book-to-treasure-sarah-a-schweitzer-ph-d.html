This association becomes a formula that is applied to any name, birth date, or event. The number and letter formula can define personality traits and characteristics that an individual may portray throughout their life. This is called ones numerology signature. 
The numerology formula can also be applied to important dates, addresses, phone numbers, and other important events in ones life to determine the compatibility of the event to ones personal numerology signature. This formula can also be applied to compare the compatibility between individuals. When applying the formula, it is easy to see who will show leadership traits in work group teams, or who will take control or be submissive when interacting with others. 
Numerology can also be applied to employment, personal, and romantic situations. It can be used as an insightful tool when blending families where children are concerned. The application of numerology in life is endless and provides insightful peeks into potential areas of life that are important to you. For example, when planning a future event, such as choosing a date for a wedding, the chosen date defines the numerology signature of the event and can have a lasting effect upon the marriage union. 
When applying numerology formulas to birth dates and life events, specific cycles emerge. These cycles can be identified and formulas applied to them that can offer valuable insights that last for the entire cycle of time. 
The knowledge within this book is everything you will ever need to know to become an expert at numerology!" />
