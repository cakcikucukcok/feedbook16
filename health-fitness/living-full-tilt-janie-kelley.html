 Rev. Dr. Edwene Gaines
In attending Rev. Janie Kelleys workshop, Living Full-Tilt, I came away with a sense of financial empowerment, permission to make more money, and to create prosperity in all areas of my life. Not only did her workshop help me break through the blocks which kept me in the mental bondage of poverty and lack, her ongoing mentorship has allowed me to step into my life Full-Tilt. I am forever grateful!
