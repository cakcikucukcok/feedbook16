  <title>God Promises Me Abundant Life - Evangelist Claudia V. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reaching for your blessing and pulling them down. And I will give into thee the
keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven.
Are you speaking the word out of your mouth, but from your heart? You dont
believe what you are saying.
Look at this in the natural. I have a peach tree in August. The peach is ripped on
the tree. Now (get this), where are peaches? They are not on the ground. They are
hanging on the peach tree ready to be pulled off or down. You need a ladder to
pull the peach down and if you want them bad enough, you will reach up and get
your peach. Now take that same determination and reach for your blessing. Reach
Gods heart. A son knows how to reach his dad.
To all the young men and women who have a college education but youre
still having problems, and you think that because your father or mother with a
second grade education, you feel they are not educated enough to talk to, that
they dont understand. You have not read the book of Proverbs 6:20-21 - My son
(and daughter), keep your fathers command, and do not forsake the law of your
mother. Bind them continually upon your heart; tie them around your neck.
The wisdom that comes from your mother and father, the biggest book cannot
retain it. Life experiences are priceless. So dont look down your nose on mom
and dad because you have a college degree. When have you said thank you? You
call everyone except mom and dad." />
