  <title>The Rigged Race of Life - Mark Romel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It takes a fool to participate in a race which he is guaranteed to lose. The race of life is designed to ensure you fail ... unless you belong to the privileged elite. This is a race in which it is not the fastest runners who win, but those who, thanks to inheritance, are brazenly placed right in front of the finishing line. They could fall over and still win. It takes a fool to support this mad game, and that&#39;s exactly what the system produces: fools in their legions. They are the foot soldiers of the Dumbocracy, the Idiocracy, the Moronarchy. They are all slavish followers of Freedumb. The 1% have done an astounding job of controlling the 99% and making the masses serve them at all times. The 99% dream of being the 1%. That&#39;s the &quot;American Dream&quot;. Those who dream of being part of the rich elite will never revolt against the rich elite, even when that&#39;s the only way to free themselves. Herbert Marcuse wrote, &quot;At the highest stage of capitalism, the most necessary revolution appears as the most unlikely one.&quot;" />
