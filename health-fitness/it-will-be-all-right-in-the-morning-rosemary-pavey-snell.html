  <title>It Will Be All Right in the Morning - Rosemary Pavey-Snell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Rosemary Pavey-Snells husband died of cancer, her world was shattered. Despite being a counsellor and psychotherapist herself, she had no way to prepare for something so terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she remembered what her husband, Allan, always used to say before going to bed: It will be all right in the morning. Most of the time, he was right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She remembered those words often, but she still experienced the same thoughts and feelings as anyone else who loses someone special. At times, she was in denial. She called upon her faith for strength. She found it difficult to ask others for help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you are suffering from a loss, counselling someone, or just trying to be a good friend, this personal journey through grief offers hope that mourning may eventually turn to joy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Rosemary Pavey-Snell gives us a poignant and, at times, heart-rending account of her own grieving after the unexpectedly early death of her beloved husband. From this experience she then provides an invaluable resource for counselors and pastoral workers who find themselves involved in the accompaniment of the bereaved. This is self-revelatory writing at its best and will be an invaluable aid to all those who have the privilege of walking alongside those in grief. It will also be a sure comfort for those who are themselves struggling with the absence of a much-loved companion.
