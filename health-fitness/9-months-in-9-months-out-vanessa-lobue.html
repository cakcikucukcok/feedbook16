  <title>9 Months In, 9 Months Out - Vanessa LoBue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Expertise can explain the science of what&#39;s happening to a fetus or a baby throughout development, but all the science in the world can&#39;t tell you what it feels like to have a baby: the pang of morning sickness, the pain of labor, the excitement of birth, and the joy that comes from seeing your baby&#39;s first smile. &lt;em&gt;9 Months In, 9Months Out&lt;/em&gt; explores what we actually experience in the nine months of pregnancy and the nine months that follow.
As a professor of infant and child development, author Vanessa LoBue had certain expectations about how pregnancy and motherhood would go. Experiencing it was a different story. As she learned, the first few months of parenthood are much harder than anyone tells you. Written month-to-month in real time as LoBue proceeded through pregnancy and first-time parenthood, &lt;em&gt;9 Months In, 9 Months Out&lt;/em&gt; integrates science and infant development with the personal journey involved in becoming a parent. LoBue also takes a researcher&#39;s lens to issues that are top of mind for new parents: breastfeeding, the sleep training controversy, gender development, the science (or lack thereof) behind the link between vaccinations and autism, and the debate over screen time." />
