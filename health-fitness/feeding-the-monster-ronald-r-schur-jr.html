  <title>Feeding the Monster - Ronald R. Schur Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As I watched the darkness descend, the distinction between sky and land
disappeared. The murky gray color covered the landscape as if a blanket were
smothering my existence. It suddenly grew very cold, and although seemingly
impossible, I felt more alone than my life ever allowed before. The darkness
entered the room, and the depths of my emptiness felt its presence. It brought
me back, back so far that I curled up in a corner much like the position I
occupied in my mothers womb so many years ago. While familiar questions
raced through my frustrated mind that night, I again realized my quest for an
answer may never be over. I prayed over and over for God to take me quietly,
without pain. I have suffered enough. My prayers went unanswered again.
With the beginning of each day, we ask the same questions. We pray for
answers; we beg to be shown the way to a better life. Alone and broken each
night, we ask, we pray for a way outa way to stop the cycle of destruction,
loneliness, and shame. Thousands of times I have repeated this conduct, but
for so long now, my futile struggle moves me further away from that which I
strongly crave to obtain. Each day, my conductalthough aware of it being
ill-advisedbrings me to a dark and pathetic place. I cannot escape myself. I
cannot forgive myself. Hopeless, hollow, and beat-up, I surrender once again
in defeat. And so the cycle continues.
My story is not unknown to mankind. It has repeated itself time and
time again. So many have experienced it, and although much of it is now
understood, it is often still unforgivable upon self-reflection. Only the
alcoholic or addict has the ability, due to experience, to completely engage the
true depth of its destruction and resulting emptiness although all in its path
suffer relentlessly and often without recourse. This book documents, to the
best of my ability, my road to addiction, destruction, and recovery." />
