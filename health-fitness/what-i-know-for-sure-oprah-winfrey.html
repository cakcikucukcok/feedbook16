  <title>What I Know For Sure - Oprah Winfrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a creative force, student of the human heart and soul, and champion of living the life you want, Oprah Winfrey stands alone. Over the years, she has made history with a legendary talk show - the highest-rated program of its kind, launched her own television network, become the nation&#39;s only African-American billionaire, and been awarded both an honorary degree by Harvard University and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  From all her experiences, she has gleaned life lessons--which, for fourteen years, she&#39;s shared in &lt;i&gt;O, The Oprah Magazine&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; widely popular &quot;What I Know For Sure&quot; column, a monthly source of inspiration and revelation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, for the first time, these thoughtful gems have been revised, updated, and collected in &lt;i&gt;What I Know For Sure,&lt;/i&gt; a beautiful cloth bound book with a ribbon marker, packed with insight and revelation from Oprah Winfrey. Organized by theme--joy, resilience, connection, gratitude, possibility, awe, clarity, and power--these essays offer a rare, powerful and intimate glimpse into the heart and mind of one of the world&#39;s most extraordinary women--while providing readers a guide to becoming their best selves. Candid, moving, exhilarating, uplifting, and frequently humorous, the words Oprah shares in &lt;i&gt;What I Know For Sure&lt;/i&gt; shimmer with the sort of truth that readers will turn to again and again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
