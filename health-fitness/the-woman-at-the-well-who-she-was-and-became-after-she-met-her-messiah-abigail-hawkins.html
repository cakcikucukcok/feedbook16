  <title>The Woman at the Well , Who She Was and Became After She Met Her Messiah - Abigail Hawkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hi my name is Abigail Hawkins. I am the modern day Samaritan woman at the well less two husbands. Like her I was lost trying to find love in relationships but often I was left broken and alone. I thought I knew Christ until I met him at the well and he showed me I worshiped what I didnt understand. It only took me being in Jesuss presence to discover his water that leads to truth, love and purpose. I was in a relationship with a man while I nursed him back to life left me for another woman. Then I married a godly man but I was too guarded to love him completely untilI I allowed Christ to touch and change my heart. Come and see what happens when Jesus meets me at the well." />
