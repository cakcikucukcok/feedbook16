  <title>Lost and Found in London - Kathleen O&#39;Hara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt; Kathleen was lost in London; now shes about
to be found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Her stay has been rich and exciting 
museums, galleries, influential people. Romantic
trips with a new lover. But UK authorities say its
time to go.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Its not their problem she doesnt want to leave, and
has no idea what to do next. Fortunately, the right
person comes along ...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; At his cosy, Wimbledon home, a.k.a. the Railway
Tracks Hotel, Chris puts Kathleen through a unique
series of exercises that enable her to identify who
she is, the life she wants  and how to get it.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; Back in Canada, she realizes her dream: to write a
book that will inspire readers in the same powerful
way Chris inspired her. This is it! Exercises, too.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; But Lost and Found in London isnt just about
personal challenges. It also deals with key issues
confronting our planet, as few books dare to do.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;  Its a timely, thought-provoking, and fun guide for
these uncertain times that could potentially change
your life.&lt;br&gt;
