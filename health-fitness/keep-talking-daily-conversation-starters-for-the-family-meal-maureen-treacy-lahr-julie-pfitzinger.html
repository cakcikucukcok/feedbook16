      <meta name="description" content="Many families today seldom take time to eat together. When they do, they often have difficulty starting a conversation or may even discover that they have little in common to talk about. Here are 288 discussion points for mealtime with your family.

Some of the points are religiously oriented; all are based on important values for modern family living. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; A wonderful gift for any family you know who would like to get to know one another better but just need a little help getting started.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Spiral-bound with easel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;a href=http://www.liguori.org/pdf/813078-sample.pdf target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;View sample pages here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" />
