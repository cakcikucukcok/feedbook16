  <title>Beneath the Sword of Damoclese - Fraser Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Although, I am not a journalist, this is a HUGELY TOPICAL book, and is a, sometimes hilarious, occasionally sad, snapshot of the life of a person who has lived through, just about the most interesting period in modern history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  I KNOW, EVERYONE SAYS THAT! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  I have had to cope in a very harsh environment with the very real problems of suffering from Multiple sclerosis, without letting it spoil a fabulous life full of hard graft and fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also covers my feelings about assisted suicide, (euthanasia) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I make no apologies or excuses, and am certainly not going to ask anyone to help me to jump under a train. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Thats just not fair on others, and it makes a mess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I was born just after World War Two, and after serving my apprenticeship where I was trained as a carpenter and joiner, I launched myself onto the world stage, which was trying to drag itself into the twentieth century? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis over thirty five years ago and have battled through a fun packed and enjoyable life ever since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Now having had to retire after forty three years in an ever changing construction industry, through the problems caused mainly by my illness, and also falling off rooftops, I have just got to put it all into writing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    People have asked me why I am writing books, and I must confess that my only reason appears to be that I need to. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Whilst fame and fortune sound very nice, I think that I have left all that far too late, and dont want to be famous anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   I also stopped believing in fairies long ago, but, if I could derive some sort of an income from my efforts, that would be nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   Although Granny used to say, Be careful what you wish for &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;  My major feelings are that I need to tell some of my stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   I would also hope for people to see things through the eyes of a person with firsthand experience of some of the issues involved without the whole saga becoming some sort of black comedy, or yet another hand wringing exercise, which will only give the chattering classes more ammo to fill their sorry lives with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    I hope my life has been worth more than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   At this time I have also finished writing a book about post war life in Britain, as seen through the eyes of an eight year old boy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  In my opinion these stories reflect a very important part of twentieth century social history, and also provide opportunities for a new book on nearly every page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    My memories keep me writing, and they are memories which are very real and unfortunately often denied to people whose experiences of life only include the late twentieth and early twenty first century. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   I know that people say that we have had the best of it, but as a raggy arsed guttersnipe brought up in post war Britain I had a very happy childhood, which has been followed by a very full and happy life.      &lt;/p&gt;     
&lt;p&gt;  AND FURTHERMORE! IT ISNT OVER YET &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;                                     Regards, &lt;/p&gt;
