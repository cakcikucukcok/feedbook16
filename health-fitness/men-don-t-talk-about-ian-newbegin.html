&lt;i&gt;Men Dont Talk About &lt;/i&gt; chronicles his journey from fear to acceptance and ultimately survival. His story is one designed to encourage men to visit their doctors more frequently, particularly when they suffer from any urinary complicationsone of the early signs of a potential problem. 
He explores his experiences with both prostate cancer and the resulting depression through candid insight. From a patients viewpoint, he provides simple explanations about each disease. Knowledge is power for anyone facing cancer (or any other chronic or acute condition), and he shares his research and experiences to help others. 
His story is one intended to demystify the diseases. He reminds the reader that there is no stigma involved with either disease, and encourages them to take control of their own care. His message is simple: If he can survive the ordeal of having cancer, so can you.
You can increase your chances by having regular medical checkups. Youre worth it." />
