  <title>Face of Courage - Joseph M. Cammarata</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Both brothers dreamed of being N.Y.C Firefighters, but when one brother wrote his own destiny, their worlds would collide at the same place, at different times on the morning of September 11th, 2001. Both brothers feverishly raced to the World Trade Center, one brother age 22, was with the New York City fire department, and one brother age 24, with the New York City police department, the catastrophe would leave one brother searching for answers to many questions, and living the better part of the last decade with enormous guilt.
   Inspirational from many aspects, it will raise the spirits of anyone who clutches non fictional work. Strap yourself in; hold on tight, this is a  true life story of two young men who exhibit tremendous courage while facing the terrors that lie right in front of their eyes.
I had to go back to the site, and search for a part of my soul that was buried under the rubble, it was gone long enough, I want my life back.&quot;
&quot;In every disaster, there are stories of hope, and heroism, good things come out of negativity, you just have to find them, no matter how long it takes.&quot;" />
