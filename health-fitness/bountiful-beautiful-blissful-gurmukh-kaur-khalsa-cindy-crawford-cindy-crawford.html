  <title>Bountiful, Beautiful, Blissful - Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa, Cindy Crawford, Cindy Crawford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From internationally renowned yoga teacher Gurmukh comes a book on pregnancy unlike any other. &lt;i&gt;Bountiful, Beautiful, Blissful&lt;/i&gt; is a treasury of wisdom, information, and inspiration for pregnancy and motherhood based on the spiritual and physical practices of Kundalini yoga, which Gurmukh has taught for the last thirty years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With illustrated, step-by-step instructions, she teaches time-tested techniques, meditations, and exercises that will help you physically, mentally, and spiritually. In the timeless way that women have passed down wisdom surrounding birth and child rearing to one another for centuries, Gurmukh weaves folk stories and contemporary testimonials into a program designed to help you get profound results in the shortest possible time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sections in this book cover each trimester of pregnancy as well as delivery and life with the baby. In her wise, gentle, and comforting voice, Gurmukh suggests meditations, exercises, and yoga positions to respond to the various needs of expectant and new mothers as you undergo dramatic body changes. Gurmukh also helps you explore and, when necessary, heal your own history and unconscious attitudes about pregnancy, birth, and parenting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Bountiful, Beautiful, Blissful,&lt;/i&gt; Gurmukh gives you all the tools you need to have a healthy and happy pregnancy while increasing your connection to your partner and building compassion and prosperity. The ancient practices of yoga can lead you back to your own power as a woman, capable of more than you ever dreamed. All you need is a belief in the possibility of change and a commitment of as little as three minutes a day. Gurmukh has helped thousands of women and their families find fulfillment through the healing movements and meditations of Kundalini yoga---and she can help you, too!&lt;/p&gt;" />
