  <title>Fruitful in Suffering - Ruth Merritt, Jo Ann Sheats</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Trials, tribulations, and every day issues belong to us all.  The pressures and hardships of life can cause us to want to throw in the towel and give up.  But take heart, Ruth Merritt assures us that we can be fruitful in Christ even in the midst of suffering.  She shares with us the story of Joseph and how God used him during the hard times in his life. Joseph didnt give up nor did he give in, but he totally trusted God. As a result of his unwavering trust and steadfastness, he was appointed to the highest position in the land. If we will stay the course and trust God completely just as Joseph did, He will use us for His highest good and we will produce much fruit even during our suffering.  So, open your heart to God as you read this book and see just how He will use you for his glory.
