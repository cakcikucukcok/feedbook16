  <title>Cancer: the Adventure of Your Life! - Teresa Kalvelage Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;This
eminently practical book includes the tips survivors share with one another -
the little coping strategies that can make a huge difference in the physical
and emotional comfort of the patient and family. The hopeful and encouraging
approach avoids the pitfalls of &quot;statistics&quot; and &quot;scientific
prognosis&quot; to focus instead on maximum joy and peace of heart for each
patient, regardless of the stage of illness. &lt;i style=&#39;mso-bidi-font-style:
normal&#39;&gt;Cancer: The Adventure of Your Life&lt;/i&gt; includes the important issues
(like losing hair, dealing with insurance companies, or handling visitors) that
doctors pass over lightly because they are not life-threatening. The
simply-written explanations are meant for the lay person, although professional
caregivers will find new insights, too. There is an extensive treatment of the
emotional components of the cancer journey, including fear, grieving, and
loneliness, along with specific suggestions for both patients and family
members to adapt to this new reality with a health-nurturing life view. Every
effort has been made to make the book convenient and easy-to-use for patients,
including large print format, stand-alone chapters, and chapter summaries. The
book is a valuable resource for cancer center libraries, waiting rooms, and
physicians&#39; offices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;The
most common response of cancer patients after reading the book is, &quot; I
wish every newly-diagnosed patient had access to this. If only I had known that
I was not alone in my fears and concerns!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
