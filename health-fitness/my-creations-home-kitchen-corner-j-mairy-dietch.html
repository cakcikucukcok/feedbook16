  <title>My Creations: Home &amp; Kitchen Corner - J. Mairy Dietch’</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;MY HOME &amp; MY KITCHEN CORNER is an informal journey through two fundamental aspects of our lives: where we live and what we eat. Home linens designed by myself are mixed with cooking recipes of my own. Alike my novels, they both reflect the idea of universality I cherish and promote since I have been lucky enough to experience a variety of cultures.
&lt;p&gt;This is how among others, you will find therein African fabrics associated with others, turning the items into something no more exclusively ethnical but neutral with a cachet, that can fit any house. Similarly, African ingredients are included into western recipes and typical African recipes are offered. Thus, the many people who have no clue on how to use the vast range of tempting worldwide products that are displayed on supermarket shelves can enjoy a different and tasty cuisine.
&lt;p&gt;Inexpensive ingredients can be turned into gourmet dishes and a mere piece of fabric can reveal itself as a beautiful table cloth just adding another piece of matching material. Since not everyone can afford it, almost all the recipes can be made without olive oil but keep being excellent when a beautiful living environment isn&#39;t about money but taste." />
