  <title>How to Pick a Lover - Wesley L. Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;While it may be considered taboo, any woman  married, single, or otherwise  should feel good about her decision to take a lover.  &lt;I&gt;How To Pick a Lover&lt;/I&gt; is a groundbreaking book written to help women have meaningful and rewarding love affairs.&lt;P/&gt; &lt;BR&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;How do you choose a lover?  There are no time-honored rules, Greek chorus, or yenta to tell you what qualities to look for or how to avoid potential minefields.  Literature is ripe with cautionary tales about bad things that happen to good women who stoop to the &quot;folly&quot; of taking a lover.  And traditionally, a womans sexuality has been secondary to that of a mans.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;How To Pick a Lover&lt;/I&gt; takes you on a journey of self-discovery, exploring your right to emotional and sexual fulfillment  including the option of having a lover.  Many of your attitudes and beliefs about courting and being courted will be challenged throughout the pages of this book.  In return, you will gain insights into the attributes and behaviors of men  positive and negative  that you must pay attention to if you are to pick a lover that is right for you.&lt;/P&gt;" />
