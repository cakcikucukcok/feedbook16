  <title>Ultimate Core Ball Workout: Strengthening and Sculpting Exercises with Over 200 Step-by-Step Photos - Jeanine Detz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;From shapely abs to the &quot;Pilates Powerhouse,&quot; core strengthening has become the main focus for today&#39;s exercise enthusiasts. Now, &lt;I&gt;Ultimate Core Ball Workout&lt;/I&gt; takes core training to a higher level with its on-the-ball variations of traditional mat exercises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The unique benefits of ball training enable the program in &lt;I&gt;Ultimate Core Ball Workout&lt;/I&gt; to produce better results in less time. Any crunch will work the abs, but this book&#39;s crunch on the ball simultaneously engages the stabilizing muscles of the abdomen and lower body, working more muscle and producing a more sculpted midsection faster. The exercises outlined in this book are suitable for all levels, from beginner to fitness professional, and the photo sequences and clearly written captions teach proper techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Offering more than just good-looking abs, the program in &lt;I&gt;Ultimate Core Ball Workout&lt;/I&gt; produces numerous health and fitness benefits, including a stronger, more supportive back, improved posture, better performance in sports, and even more enjoyable sex. Plus, each exercise is presented with tips and modifications to increase the challenge so readers can continue to improve and get stronger over time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
