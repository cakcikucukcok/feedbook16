This insightful book illuminates how you have in fact been born with the ability to change harmful family patterns and also, carry the obligation to do so. We have inherited some great, and not so great, things from our ancestors. It is time to recognize what needs to be cherished, eliminated, and what we need to take from there and improve.
Learn to recognize a pattern as being, not your own, but part of your familys Pattern or Karma.
We must be aware of:
	Ego vs Soul
	Different types of Karma, from personal, family, and collective.
	A deeper explanation about the family patterns, which she believes is now in the DNA or Genome of a person.
Contrary to some beliefs, Rev Borges contends it is possible to change dysfunctional patterns. She also shows us step by step how to change these patterns through a series of exercises and prayers.
A true road to success is paved with happiness, joy and peace." />
