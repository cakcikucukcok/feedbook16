Please note that a percentage of the proceeds from this book will go to help fund missions in Haiti. With your generous support, we can make a big difference in the lives of others while helping ourselves to become the best we can be!
Coming soon will be ABCs of Healthy Relations: Book Two: For Couples Only will provide a critical insight specifically for married couples. Although other couples can glean wisdom from the practical tips as well, I especially encourage engaged couples to pick up this book and to read it together.
Book Two: For Couples Only will have parts of Book One, but will delve deeper into intimacy, sexuality, and nakedness especially as it relates to couples." />
