  <title>Helping Elderly Relatives - Jill Eckersley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By 2033, almost a quarter of the British population is predicted to be over 65, and 5% will be over 85. This means that more of us will be responsible for someone who is elderly and possibly frail. Yet, even in this age of the internet, many of us have no idea what older people are entitled to, and much help and money goes unclaimed. In addition, not everyone ages gracefully. The problems can be compounded by someone who is difficult to help, and refuses to co-operate with family carers or medical and social work professionals. This book offers practical solutions and emotional support for those looking after older parents or other relatives. Topics include: • Mental distress in later life, such as anxiety and depression • The rise in problem drinking among older people • Mental disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder; personality disorder • Dementia • Housing and social options • If the relationship breaks down • Care for the carer - looking after yourself" />
