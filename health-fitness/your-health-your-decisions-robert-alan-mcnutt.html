  <title>Your Health, Your Decisions - Robert Alan McNutt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In nearly every medical-decision-making encounter, the physician is at the center of the discussion, with the patient the recipient of the physician&#39;s decisions. Dr. Robert Alan McNutt starts from a very different premise: the patient should be at the center. McNutt challenges the physician-directed, medical-expertise model of making decisions, presenting a practical approach augmented by formal exercises designed to give patients the tools and confidence to compare and contrast their health-care options so they can make their own choices. He addresses a number of scenarios, including heart disease, breast cancer, and prostate cancer&amp;mdash;conditions that pose a range of choices that patients may face about diagnoses and treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After providing a clear explanation of what is the highest quality medical-decision-making information, McNutt teaches patients to use that information to weigh the harms and benefits of their treatment options, empowering them to ask critical questions as they take a stronger hand in their own care. &lt;i&gt;Your Health, Your Decisions&lt;/i&gt; moves from specific scenarios that commonly baffle patients to a systematic exploration of how to make medical decisions. By offering patients the tools they need to be full partners in their own health care, McNutt demystifies what can be a bewildering and even terrifying process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
