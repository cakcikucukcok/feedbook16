  <title>Keeping up with the Jones&#39;s - Stella M. Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The twelfth child of fifteen; Growing up during the Great Depression was not easy. Our parents struggled to supply Our basic needs. Home was a secure place, a happy place where we were protected and allowed to be in touch with our true selves. We survived without running water, electricity, phones and many things you take for granted today.
To the younger generations of all families: I encourage you to spend time with your grandparents and great grandparents. Sit at their feet, listen to their stories, research their history. Your fore fathers worked hard and endured more than you&#39;ll ever know in order for you to have a better life.
There are so many opportunities available to you today. Stay in school, pursue your dreams. &quot;Dream Big, Reach for the Sky&quot;. Don&#39;t squander youth away following the wrong crowd. They are usually on a path of destruction. &quot;Be A Leader&quot;.
We are put on this earth for a reason. Ask yourselves these questions. Who am I? What is my purpose? What are my God given gifts and talents? What is His will for my life. Ask Gods guidance... You will find the answers. When you find them follow His plan and stand strong, you will persevere.
&quot;I know the plans I have for you, &quot;declares the Lord, &quot;planes to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.&quot; 
Jeremiah 29:11" />
