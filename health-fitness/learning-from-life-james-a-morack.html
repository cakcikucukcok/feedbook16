  <title>Learning from Life - James A. Morack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every one of us is on our own unique journey through life. And each of our journeys contains many learning opportunities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What we choose to do with those learning opportunities shapes our individual destinies. How we respond to life, its challenges, and its blessings defines us for who we truly are.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Learning from Life describes one mans journey. It highlights the significant yet simple ideas that have played a role in not only his ability to survive challenges, but to understand and grow from them. Therein lies the magnificence of truly learning from life. Some of those lessons include the importance of gratitude, taking care of yourself, dealing with fear, going beyond our comfort zone, self-discovery, setting goals, and much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is real joy in knowing that at any point in your life you can create a new beginning. This book will provide you with insights and ideas on how you can do that too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With each lesson learned comes a new beginning, a chance to step out once more and do things differently the next time. Armed with a greater understanding of what comes from finding the beneficial aspects of our life experiences, we can greet each new moment in our lives with a fresh perspective, one that hopefully makes living more enjoyable for us and those around us. And in greeting that new moment with a fresh perspective, we create new beginnings for ourselves continually." />
