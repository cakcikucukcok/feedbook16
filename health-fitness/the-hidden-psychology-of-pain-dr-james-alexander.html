  <title>The Hidden Psychology of Pain - Dr. James Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;Chronic pain has been correctly described as the invisible crisis at the heart of contemporary life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite stunning advances in other areas of medical science, no similar breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain has resulted from an exclusive focus on the body. Dr James Alexanders young life was redefined by a tragic car accident in his late teens, and the chronic physical and emotional trauma inspired him to become a psychologist. Now pain-free, Dr Alexander has dedicated the last three decades of his life to helping others overcome similar challenges, specializing in the treatment of chronic pain and psychological trauma. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His success is proof that recovery from chronic pain is possible, and this guide offers a valuable resource for working toward that goal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recovery from chronic pain requires that we revisit and challenge the outdated attitudes and practices that have been used with little result. With the proliferation of medical and psychological research, for the first time we are at a point in history where these notions of pain recovery can be validated by research-based evidence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For too long, Dr Alexander feels, we have been looking in all the wrong places. Specifically, the problem lies at the core of our culture, which still treats the physical and nonphysical aspects of the human as separate experiences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This innovative program involves a journey of self-discovery, a new way to approach medical and psychological care of chronic pain, and advice on the most effective types of help to pursue.&lt;/div&gt;" />
