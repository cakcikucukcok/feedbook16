  <title>America’S Irresistible Attraction - John S. Dinga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Part travelogue and part memoire, John S. Dingas newest book is a sequel to Navigating the Contradictions of America and explores disparities between Americas past and present, from the perspective of an immigrant. Featuring characters both real
and fictional, Dinga shares his observations about the realities of making a new life in a new country, with an occasional flashback to the former home. 
The desire to immigrate to America is one shared by people all over the world, people who are often unaware of what it takes to thrive in a competitive, capitalist world where nothing is the same as before. Settling down in a new environment and navigating the politics and stresses of finding a job are just two of the aspects of culture shock a new immigrant will face. Expectations and responsibilities from those back home also add to the new immigrants challenges, and Dinga offers his suggestions on how to thrive under those stresses as well. He speaks not only to the potential immigrant but to those officials in power on either side of the process as well. 
Learning to make the right choices when presented with so many options is another life lesson addressed. The American society, freedoms, choices, and government are envied in many corners of the world, and Dinga explores how that perception influences the decision to start the journey. People need to know that living in America has its challengeschallenges not often imagined when the desire to immigrate pushes them to cross deserts, oceans, and unfriendly skies." />
