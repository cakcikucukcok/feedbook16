  <title>Rena, My Eternal Love - Jack Gilley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jack and Rena Gilley first met as small children and were ultimately married May-27, 1954, a year after Jack was discharged from the army. The story covers the war &amp; 56+ years of their life together which portrays the love that grows stronger with each passing day. 
     The story covers highlights of the Gilley family (with two children) living abroad for more than ten years where they spent time in Libya and Brazil (Their son was born in Libya in 1959) where Jack worked for TI-GSI. After reassignment to Dallas headquarters in 1967 Jack traveled throughout the world visiting/inspecting their operations before resigning to attend their family business started in 1970. 
     It also covers two tours of duty Jack served in Korea before discharge in 1953. In 1951 while in a military hospital in Japan, a wounded soldier from his brothers unit (The 187th Airborne) in the adjacent bed told him the unit incurred heavy casualties. Jack got an early release to search for his brother (during convalescence leave) who he feared had been killed. It is truly an unbelievable story. It also covers their time in Brazil during the military takeover in the 1960s and time in Libya during the Mid-East war where the families were evacuated to Malta. 
     The story covers the starting of Gilley Properties Inc., a land development and building business in 1970 that included six land developments. The building business employed their family members and many long term sub-contractors who worked for them 20+ years. A second business Five Star Industries Inc. was started in 1997. 
     The story covers an exciting life of love, world travels &amp; war. Jack retired at the age of 55, but remained active in the family business. He and RENA have been married 56-plus years..." />
