      <meta name="description" content="A BLUEPRINT for SUCCESS is the architectural rendition of what success should look like. It will give you the detail and various views of the concept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is no secret that achieving goals is a personal and individual pursuit. Your goals are invariably different to those of your neighbor. One important secret in pursuing your goal is in your ability to identify it clearly and distinctly. Accomplishing any goal for success requires us to make changes to the identified product/service/present condition or situation, in order to produce what we are trying to achieve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While difficult to define success succinctly, we have been given many pointers along the way. Successful and well-known people have always given us food for thought. A few examples are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.&amp;quot; John R. Wooden&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.&amp;quot; Lao Tzu&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;What the mind can conceive, it can achieve.&amp;quot; Napoleon Hill&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If opportunity doesn&amp;#39;t knock, build a door.&amp;quot; Milton Berle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Celebrity Experts(R) in this book have dedicated themselves to their goals. Their blueprints include the good, the bad and the ugly. They are not afraid of success or failure. Their experiences will guide and mentor you as you pursue your own goals and begin designing your own SUCCESS BLUEPRINT." />
