  <title>Finding a Break in the Clouds - Kyrai Eya Ann Antares</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finding A Break In The Clouds&lt;/b&gt; brings the dark and elusive mystery of eating disorders to a comprehensible light by naming it. The &quot;invader&quot; (anorexia/bulimia) and its thugs (Guilt, Shame, and the fear monster) are exposed and conquered during the reader&#39;s experience. This is accomplished through use of symbols, interactive activity breaks, fresh new perspectives, and unique journal exercises -- all based on the newly-planted seed of self-care - &quot;There is nothing wrong with me!&quot; While implementing this unique process, the eating disorder is seen as less of a tragedy, and more of an opportunity to build a new, impervious strength.
&lt;p&gt;
With this creative workbook, the reader gains access to the warrior within, signs a declaration of war on the invader, signs a peace treaty with food, learns how to naturally and gently re-nourish the body, rescues stifled emotions, builds a House of Being, constructs a relapse prevention kit, and climbs the clouds to reach the sunshine of freedom from food illness. The readers is able to separate himself/herself from anorexia/bulimia, and uncover the innate greatness which was there all along. In the last chapter, a peace treaty with the invader is signed, and the reader writes a good-bye letter to the eating disorder, acknowledging it as an experiential teacher.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Finding A Break In The Clouds&lt;/b&gt; also reaches out to family members and friends who are attempting to understand what is happening to their loved one. Chapter ten (Frequently Asked Questions) and Chapter Eleven (Tips For Family and Friends) offer family members, friends, peers, and spouses a new inside understanding of the world of anorexia/bulimia, as well as advice on what to do, and what not to do when trying to help.
&lt;p&gt;
Filled with diverse activities and exercises, &lt;b&gt;Finding A Break In The Clouds&lt;/b&gt; allows each person to find the unique internal system of recovery which can ignite the individual healing process, and light the path to well-being." />
