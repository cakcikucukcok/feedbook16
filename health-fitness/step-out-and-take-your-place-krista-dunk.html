&lt;p&gt;The expression of your gift is an act of worship to God. Krista Dunk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve probably heard that God has a special plan for your life, right? However, you may not have any idea what that plan is or how to discover it. Or maybe you have discovered a Sunday morning calling, but Monday to Saturday feels dry and unsatisfying. Unfortunately, that is a familiar story for too many of us - Gods people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Out and Take Your Place gives you the practical, how-to information you need to find out what gifts God has equipped you with and what they&#39;re for. Action steps, assessment tools, advice, biblical references, compelling real-life stories, how to seek God for His plan, and much more is includedall designed to help you Step Out and Take Your Place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time to step out. Are you ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In one of the most authentic voices I have ever encountered, Krista delivers the encouragement, inspiration and tools for anyone who has ever struggled with finding purpose, asked what now or whats next, or trembled over the question, Who, me? If you have wondered about your gifts or how to honor them with your life, this is your book. It is a blessing, beginning with page 1. &lt;/i&gt;
