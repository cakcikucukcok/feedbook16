      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Second Time Around&lt;/em&gt; begins where &lt;em&gt;Lake Biwa Wishes&lt;/em&gt; ends. Toni Chang Morgan, still hurting from the discovery that her late husband had been having an affair, travels to Japan. She reconnects with playboy skier, Ken Nakamura, with whom she fell in love years ago. He also is widowed and when he proposes, she immediately accepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toni discovers that Ken&amp;rsquo;s friend, Vivica James, was his first love when he was a graduate student. She identifies Vivica as her enemy and is jealous of her and all the women attracted to Ken. Will her incessant jealousy destroy their new marriage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ken and Toni move to Idaho with his five-year old daughter, Kyoko, he leaves his pre-teen son in Japan at a boarding school. Toni continues her job as an engineer in the National Laboratory, while Ken teaches ski school and performs exhibition skiing in the local ski resorts. Ken has an accident, can no longer ski, and has to return to Japan to work for his wealthy, estranged father. Toni quits her job and with Kyoko, joins Ken. Will Toni be expected to be a Japanese wife? Or can she keep her American ways?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, their blended family bears no resemblance to TV&amp;rsquo;s Brady Bunch. Can this marriage be successful despite the differences in culture, countries, and socio/economic status? Join Toni and Ken as they attempt to rebuild a family loaded with excess attitudinal baggage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
