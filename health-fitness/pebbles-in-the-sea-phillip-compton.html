  <title>Pebbles in the Sea - Phillip Compton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pebbles in the Sea&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; by &lt;b&gt;Phillip Compton&lt;/b&gt; is an absorbing narrative made out of a canvas of colorful characters. It is a highly readable account of life in the rough and its impact on the authors view of life. Having spent his formative years with these characters and their flamboyant, sometimes hilarious ventures, the author discovered connections binding this diverse past with his artistic present. Within this framework of writing, the author reveals the concept of living for goals beyond the self, which may not produce riches or bring happiness, but will touch the infinite. 
Phillip Compton traces his journey of discovery through his early contact with these incredible characters and the history of their exploits, vividly brought to life in the pages of Pebbles in the Sea. Leading the cast of players is the authors father. Professional race car driver, business man, raconteur extraordinaire, the elder Compton was the dynamic force attracting and binding this diverse assemblage, which included his long time friend, Lou, who always encouraged, joined and abetted him in his outlandish adventures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then, a later character, who became indispensable in lending aid was Drunken Ed, a man infamous for mangling the English language. Also found within this narrative is the elusive Johnny, an ornery alcoholic who always had his job waiting for him after his many benders. Finally, Drunken Joe exuberantly plays his part with his uniquely eccentric personality. These and a host of others paint a picture of what it means to live beyond the self.
Stranger than fiction is a term often used by incredulous listeners upon hearing the tales of these men. Indeed, the reader will undoubtedly forget at times that these are actual events recorded here without embellishment. Here are stories of race car drivers, steel workers and drunks along with the famous fireworks story, recorded here for the first time, a story which has become a Compton family legend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The author has deftly woven the rough stories of these rough men together with the history of his own unique life. Within these pages, the stories diverge, then reunite in a conclusion that unexpectedly reconciles the apparent disparities. Pebbles in the Sea is a humorous, sometimes touching, often thought-provoking but always compelling chronicle of life and the adventures of living." />
