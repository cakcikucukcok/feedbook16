      <meta name="description" content="Virtually every person who has ever lived has wondered if we exist, either in body, soul, or spirit, before our physical birth, and after our physical death. Virtually every religion, civilization, philosophy, and culture has answered both questions with a resounding &quot;YES!&quot; In fact, modern scientists have shown us overwhelming evidence that our body, soul, or spirit exists prior to our physical birth, and after our brain, heart, and lungs cease to function. Join me for an incredible journey. By understanding who we are, and how to live in the world, we will know what the world is all about, and thus live a life of happiness, health, money, and love." />
