  <title>The Boss Is In: - Robert M. Hardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most of us have had a bad boss at sometime. Consequences range from minor annoyances to health issues to life or death. &lt;p&gt;
The author takes true stories of stand alone cases from big company environments and identifies bad boss behaviors. He looks at serious cases -- cheating, lying, discriminating, stealing, cultural diversity, gender and even religion related problems. Also intricately planned unfairness. Some are contrary to what one is accustomed to reading. Each case focuses on a snapshot or a moving account that exemplifies a boss behavior -- like an unauthorized biography. Some are under the radar of the higher leadership -- some are in line. The cases play out in the longer term. &lt;p&gt;
Facts in each case are analyzed. A case might have a simple solution except for the reluctance to discuss taboos or politically incorrect issues.  &lt;p&gt;
While there is no condoning bad bosses, there may be identifiable (treatable) reasons -- such as the case of the boss with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and others. &lt;p&gt;
See if you would come to the same conclusions. See if you agree with the actions taken by the players. See what you would do if faced with any of these situations." />
