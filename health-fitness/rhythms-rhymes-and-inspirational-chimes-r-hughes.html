      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rhythms, Rhymes and Inspirational Chimes offers a delightful way to stay in tune with how God sees us each day. An individual story is told in every writing and poem, including the powerful Introduction. Enjoy the rhythmic flow of words that can soothe your soul and make you whole. Smile as you read I WonderDid Moses Laugh? or reminisce with the flow of An Evening of Remembrance. Be encouraged and determined with Can You Dare to Go through Life and ponder the condition of society with Faxing, Waxing, and Income Taxing. Read these and many, many, more as your spirit comes alive with laughter as you engulf yourself in My Money is Funny, When Texting Was a Book, and Whats Sunday without Chicken. Let this powerful spiritual weapon get you up, get you busy, and get you crackinall in the name of Jesus! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So take the plunge, dive in and become a partaker in one of the most refreshing experiences a book can offer; for such a time as this.  Enjoy! &lt;/p&gt;" />
