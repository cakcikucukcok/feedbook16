  <title>Never Too Old to Dream - Theresa Lockwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theresa was a normal happy little girl till one day her whole world came crashing down.  The first turning point for her was when her father left the family home, she adored her father she couldnt understand why he had walked out of her life.
She grew up being bitter to-wards life especially men, but when she was 17yrs she met a young man, and the following year they married .
Some years later, Theresa now aged 37yrs and after divorcing her 1st and later her 2nd  husband  -  life began to improve for her. Then one day returning home from work she realised she was being followed, as she neared a row of shops she was  suddenly attacked from behind, it was her ex-husband Richard.
He pushed her hard  to the wall and held her with his body restraining her  from running, one hand around her throat the other raised into a fist.  She wanted to scream, but his grip was too tight,  expecting his fist she closed her eyes and prayed.
In desperation she kicked out,  catching him on the leg with the heel of her shoe, he cried out loosing his grip on her.
She tried to run, he lunged at her once again, catching her by her hair  pulling her violently backwards, she lost her footing and fell through the glass shop window.
Richard then turned and fled as the shopkeeper, upon hearing the crash, came running shouting --  he would call the police, she was saved.  She managed to reach home and once inside, doors firmly locked and bolted, she sank into her big arm chair and sobbed uncontrollably , she was lucky, no major injurys.
Life she realised was slowly once again turning against her, everything she had fought so hard for was slowly slipping away, she could not and would not go through her past life style again it was too painful and horrific, she had to fight against the cruel hand of fate anyway she could, her strength yet again would be put to the test.  Her only solace was her beloved Adam." />
