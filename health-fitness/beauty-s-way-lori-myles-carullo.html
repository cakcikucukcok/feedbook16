  <title>Beauty’S Way - Lori Myles-Carullo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspired by the Navajo traditions Beauty Way, this book acts as an exposition on various vital aspects of life, as well as how to uncover and create true beauty within them all. Author Lori Myles-Carullo struggled with chronic illness for many years and, through the depth of her own healing journey, developed a passion for sharing the wisdom she gained in the process. The essence of beauty explored here is neither about personal appearance nor image, but rather the rich, lived experience of the heart awakening to love and letting go of fear.  
Each one of us has a great capacity for radical honesty, courage, and transformationand often life provides us with exactly what we need to draw these forth in dramatic and powerful ways. Whether our wake-up calls occur through loss, transition, illness, or relationship struggles, we all have the choice to either contract or expand through our experiences, creating therefore less or more beauty in our lives and the lives of others.  
Beautys Way gifts you with practical suggestions, through personal story and anecdote, of how to bring more beauty to your existence and to the greater whole. Each chapter ends with specific exercises that will assist you in gaining greater awareness into key parts of lifesome naturally thought of as good, such as love and joy, as well as other, more challenging ones that we often do our best to distract ourselves from due to fear, including pain and grief. By offering our heartfelt compassion and love to it all, a greater realization and manifestation of healing beauty is forever possible." />
