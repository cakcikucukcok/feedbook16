  <title>Pushing Double Nickels - Bradley Stewart Fischl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Obesity is an epidemic in America and worldwide. This former IT industry veteran shares his cautionary tale (and success!) with his personal fight against obesity and smoking cigarettes. Including tips on living with Type II Diabetes, chronic pain, and a host of other things that he has learned in his 55 years on this planet so far, Pushing Double Nickels has something for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the &quot;50 Things&quot; covered in this book:&lt;/p&gt;
            A simple long-term way to lose weight permanently.
            How to quit cigarettes forever on the first try.
            The advantages of being an optimist.
            Advice and tips on Public Speaking.
            Advice for Business Professionals.
            Why Mystery Shopping is no mystery.
            You can improve yourself at any age!
            Why you are connected with everyone on Earth.
            80 total life lessons, interesting facts, and much food for thought.
            Includes hundreds of web links you can use for further information!
&lt;p&gt;Pushing Double Nickels is meant to educate, illuminate, and motivate you into doing something positive for yourself, a loved one, your community, and your planet. Positive change is something that everyone can do beginning at any age. All it takes is the desire to improve and the self-motivation to make the long-term lifestyle changes necessary to accomplish your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-term fixes such as surgery, diet plans or programs, diet pills or shakes, etc. will only work for a short time. More often than not if the weight returns because the person did not make the long-term, lifestyle changes required for lasting results. What is needed is a way to live that you can continue to do for decades and for the rest of your life. Diet control is the key factor. All the diet plans and exercise in the world can&#39;t undo taking in more calories than you burn off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-improvement is much more than just losing weight or quitting smoking, it includes moral and ethical improvement as well. But getting your health in order is the first step. If you are overweight or obese then you are also more than likely dealing with other &quot;bad&quot; numbers like high blood sugar (Diabetes or Prediabetes), high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and now face a much shorter life-span as a result. And quitting cigarettes can be done on the first try. So, it&#39;s time to take control. Time to finally do something to make sure that you&#39;re going to be around a while longer. In Pushing Double Nickels I share how this old IT guy and former couch potato who was clinically obese and had a 30+ year smoking habit, took control, quit on the first try, and walked off over 100 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all in this together but, making positive changes to humanity require making those changes individually first.&lt;/p&gt;" />
