  <title>American Heroes Coming out from Behind the Badge - Greg Miraglia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine working in a job you always dreamed of having and working in a career that excites and fulfills you in every way.  Consider what it would be like to be highly successful in your work, admired by your peers, but always fearful that if anyone you work with discovered your secret, it could all be over.  This is what it is like to be a closeted gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender member of law enforcement.  And in the fire service and emergency medical services profession, the condition is even worse because of the common housing situation required while working a 24 to 48 hour shift.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;Its true that society as a whole has become more accepting of gay and lesbian people, but homophobia continues to be pervasive in much of the public safety arena.  Most states still do not have any employment protection against harassment and discrimination based on sexual orientation.  Imagine being fired from the job you love because of who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Heroes Coming Out From Behind The Badge is Greg Miraglias second book intended to show examples of how police officers, firefighters, and EMS professionals have been able to come out and be successful on the job.  The stories come from across the country and tell of a very personal and courageous journey.  They are intended to both inspire and educate.  The book contains a section on how to come out as well as a section with resources and associations supporting LGBT public safety professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is ideal for anyone who is struggling to come out as well as for straight allies who want to learn more about how to support their LGBT colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;" />
