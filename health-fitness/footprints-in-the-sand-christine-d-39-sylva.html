  <title>Footprints In the Sand - Christine D&#39;Sylva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who has never had troubles, anguish or despair? We feel acute loneliness during these times. Our burdens seem too heavy to bear. Yet when we turn our eyes to heaven and pray for solace, Christ promises us his love. He, not only walks with us along the path leaden with rocks and thorns but he in fact carries us, lightening our burdens with his gentle touch. Christianity promises us eternal life if we walk with Jesus every day. This book seeks to explore the messages from the Bible and reminds us of the words from the Bible.  &quot;Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord, your God goes with you, he will never forsake you.&#39;             The words of the famous hymn should encourage us &quot;I will never forsake you, my people. I have carved you on the palm of my hand.&quot;             Our one set of footprints left behind in the sand only serve to remind us of God&#39;s infinite love for each one of us." />
