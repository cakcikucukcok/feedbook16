  <title>Forever Just Married - Marilyn Pelz, Kent Pelz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is said that every life has a story and every story has a lesson. Forever Just Married is the story of a young man and woman who fell madly in love the first time they met and parlayed the initial fireworks into an amazing 55+ year relationship  overcoming betrayal, heartbreak and deception. The result is a unique coupling of two strong willed, independent people who grew both individually and together because of one important decision they made along the way: We will give in but we will never give up. Both agree they have been divorced and remarried many times  but always to the same person. 
The story traces the amazing journey of Marilyn and Kent Pelz, from their initial blind date in 1961 in Mission Hills, Kansas, to their 30-year stint in one house overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu, California, to their current lives as minister and spiritual counselors in San Jose. In this book, Kent and Marilyn reveal the major challenges they faced, how they overcame these challenges, and the lessons they learned about how to create a workable and sustainable relationship with each other and others. 
Forever Just Married is a chronological overview of the authors married life. They highlight a particular struggle or unconscious behavior that played out over their lifetimes and how they overcame it and the lessons they learned. They offer suggested exercises that the reader and his/her partner can utilize to fully benefit from the authors life experiences." />
