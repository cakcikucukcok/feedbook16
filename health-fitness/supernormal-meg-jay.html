  <title>Supernormal - Meg Jay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Clinical psychologist and author of &lt;i&gt;The Defining Decade, &lt;/i&gt;Meg Jay takes us into the world of the supernormal: those who soar to unexpected heights after childhood adversity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Whether it is the loss of a parent to death or divorce; bullying; alcoholism or drug abuse in the home; mental illness in a parent or a sibling; neglect; emotional, physical or sexual abuse; having a parent in jail; or growing up alongside domestic violence, nearly 75% of us experience adversity by the age of 20. But these experiences are often kept secret, as are our courageous battles to overcome them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Drawing on nearly two decades of work with clients and students, Jay tells the tale of ordinary people made extraordinary by these all-too-common experiences, everyday superheroes who have made a life out of dodging bullets and leaping over obstacles, even as they hide in plain sight as doctors, artists, entrepreneurs, lawyers, parents, activists, teachers, students and readers. She gives a voice to the supernormals among us as they reveal not only &quot;How do they do it?&quot; but also &quot;How does it feel?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  These powerful stories, and those of public figures from Andre Agassi to Jay Z, will show supernormals they are not alone but are, in fact, in good company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Marvelously researched and compassionately written, this exceptional book narrates the continuing saga that is resilience as it challenges us to consider whether -- and how -- the good wins out in the end." />
