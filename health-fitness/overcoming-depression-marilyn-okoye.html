  <title>Overcoming Depression - Marilyn Okoye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;Overcoming Depression speaks on Spiritual and Natural Insight about Clinical Depression&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming Depression One Christians Perspective is a personal account detailing how one woman overcame depression through natural and spiritual intervention.  Marilyn Okoye experienced first-hand the effects of clinical depression.  As a Christian, Okoye had to reconcile the often minimized symptons of depression to the very real emotional despair of living day to day with real hopelessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Okoye challenges the reader to acknowledge the real pain that many are living with daily because of undiagnosed depression.  She further encourages those suffering from depression to value who they are in God enough to take their symptoms seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Using scripture and poetry throughout the book, Okoye provides a unique approach to healing and self-discovery.  The book encourages the reader to become mentally, emotionally, and spiritually healthy.  Okoye demonstrates for us that with Gods help one can truly be free from depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would not let the emotional despair of depression take hold of my life without taking a stand; so, I purposed in my heart to take this journey to overcome depression leaning and depending on the everlasting arms of Jesus.  This particular time in my life was an emotional roller coaster I had never ridden before.  So, as I tell my testimony of overcoming depression and how God delivered me from going down into the emotional pit of depression, it is my prayer that you would also purpose in your heart to overcome because greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world (Jn. 4:4).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is help naturally, emotionally, and spiritually is the message of this book." />
