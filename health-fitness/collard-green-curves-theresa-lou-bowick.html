The book reminds us to let, no man or woman hinder us from achieving our ultimate goal(s)." />

    	<p>The author takes the reader on an incredible, tear jerking, journey of a misguided little girl so consumed with self- hate, misinformation, and distrust that it catapulted her into a life filled with unbelievable challenges. Repeated rejections, major disappointments and misunderstandings contributed to distrust of everyone she would encounter throughout her life, including her family. In her search for love, fulfillment and acceptance, the author depicts a life turned upside down through a confusing series of curves and detours destined to destroy her and anyone in her path, until she found the right recipe for healing which comes with forgiveness of self and others. Forgiveness is presented as the key to putting the past in perspective, finding a way to emerge from the depths of despair, then, shifting the focus to overcoming addictions, moving forward, and living a healthy, God directed, victorious life.
