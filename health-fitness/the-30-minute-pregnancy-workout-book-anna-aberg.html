  <title>The 30-Minute Pregnancy Workout Book - Anna Aberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Fresh and Effective Approach to Staying Toned During Pregnancy--in just 30 Quick Minutes a Day At Home or on the Road&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy is no time to let yourself go--and with Anna Aberg&#39;s surprisingly efficient light weight program, the forty weeks of waiting may even be a time to get stronger and fitter!  When Aberg--a former Miss Sweden and personal trainer--was pregnant with her first child, she couldn&#39;t find an exercise routine that would &lt;i&gt;increase&lt;/i&gt; her fitness while safeguarding her pregnancy.  Stretching, yoga, and light aerobics--standard fare for pregnant women--weren&#39;t enough for this high-performance mom-to-be.  Aberg developed a daily regimen of 2- to 10-pound weight training that could be done anywhere at any time.  The system she developed and perfected to keep herself in shape is all here, divided into three sets for each trimester of pregnancy.  It focuses on abs, arms, thighs, butts, and shoulders and promises: increased strength, enhanced endurance, a cap on body fat and more flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aberg&#39;s &lt;i&gt;30-Minute Pregnancy Workout Book&lt;/i&gt; will tone any mother and keep truly active exercisers in peak condition throughout their pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
