  <title>Keeping Your Life on Track - Mz. Brenessa David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We can be inspired in our daily lives by people and things that touch us in the way we listen and view our experience that motivate and encourage us to see beauty in lifes simple pleasures and its profound moments.
Writing can be a cathartic stress reliever, as a mother of four plus a few more you get use to talking to yourself writing is a bridge to that communication gap.  You leave notes, send text and when all else fails write a book.
I would encourage everyone to write if have started continue.  If you have not started its worth the effort.  You will be amazed at how written thoughts jump right off the page giving you analysis and insight.  The conversation you have in print can be life altering.  The two people on the planet that it never benefits you to hide from or lie to is yourself and your mother.  State the facts tell the truth free yourself.
My writing is an extension of being a mother, a nurse, a friend, a sister, and an aunt to be encouraging, uplifting and giving people hope can be life changing.  You want to motivate people to be the best of who they are.  A kind word a smile and hug can make the world of difference in a persons day.
We can all find ourselves on any given day in these subtitles: Everybody needs a hug, The comfort zone, Sound Off, and Get out of your own way.
When you can lift someones spirit, make someone laugh, encourage, inspire and motivate them, the world is a better place.
Dont give up on your dreams
