  <title>Farewell My Pashtun - Mark Frew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Faisal, an Afghani from the Pashtun tribe, begins attending Michael Farril&amp;#39;s English as a Second Language class, Michael has every reason to be terrified. This Faisal has all the external signs of being a Muslim extremist and a potential terrorist. However, as Michael gets to know Faisal, he realises that things aren&amp;#39;t what they originally seemed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually a very strong friendship develops between these two men. In so doing, each man has to adjust his thinking to the other&amp;#39;s beliefs and outlooks on life. Michael has to re-evaluate his views and opinions about refugees and Muslims, and Faisal has to learn to appreciate that Michael&amp;#39;s openly gay lifestyle is one of many aspects of the freedom granted within the country in which Faisal is seeking asylum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Faisal, Michael learns all about Afghanistan, its history and the current developments which caused thousands of refugees to flee the country. Michael then becomes heavily involved in a long, suspenseful and drawn out battle in order to save Faisal from being refused protection.&lt;/p&gt;" />
