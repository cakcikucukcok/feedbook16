  <title>The Power of Faith - Ariel Paz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is a journey and an adventure. At times, the road is a thrilling rollercoaster ride and at others it is paved with pains and potholes. Sometimes we lose our way and life careens out of our control but these events dont have to side track us forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The detours we take can propel us onto the road that leads to our destiny while transforming us in the process. When we understand that difficulties are meant to move us forward in our journey, we learn to see obstacles as opportunities and trials as tests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret to moving forward on the road of life is a gift we all have deep within, called Faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faith is the fuel that fires up our engine. It is the power behind the promises and the light that dispels darkness. Without it, we will never become the people we were created to be or live the life we dream of. Simply put, Faith is believing in a better tomorrow, ditching victim mentality, and putting action behind intention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Power of Faith &lt;/em&gt;contains simple steps that will guide you to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Activate your secret weapon&lt;br /&gt; Banish doubt, guilt, and fear&lt;br /&gt; Be healed from emotional wounds&lt;br /&gt; See difficulties as stepping stones to your destiny&lt;br /&gt; Increase your confidence, contentment, and creativity&lt;br /&gt; Achieve your goals and dreams&lt;br /&gt; Enjoy a life of bliss and blessing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now is the time to take a step in a new direction. Open your heart and mind and
embark upon your journey to Faith. You will never be the same!
