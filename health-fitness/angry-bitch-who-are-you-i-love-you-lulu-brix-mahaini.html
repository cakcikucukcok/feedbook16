  <title>Angry Bitch! Who Are You? I Love You. - Lulu Brix Mahaini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his speech on our wedding day, my husband said, One of the things I love about you is how happy you always are. As the years passed another part of me than happy seemed to take control over my life: an angry bitch! I tried my hardest to avoid, deny, and suppress her existence in my life. I tried blaming other people for my frustration, but nothing seemed to work. It was only when I found myself unreasonably angry with my two young, innocent daughters that I realized I had some inner work to do instead of projecting my anger onto the world. &lt;br /&gt;
This book is about life, love, and overcoming struggles. It tells the tales of some of the things I learned on my journey of self-discovery, acceptance, embracing my shadows, self-forgiveness, and turning many of my previous beliefs upside down. It shares how I used the tools I learned as an integrative shadow coach to get to know, make peace with, and bring love to all parts of myselfeven the angry bitch. By opening up to, embracing, and loving my inner angry bitch, she finally relaxedand I found myself a lot wiser, happier, and back in control of my life again." />
