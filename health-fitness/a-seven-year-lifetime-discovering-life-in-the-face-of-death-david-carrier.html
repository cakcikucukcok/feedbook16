  <title>A Seven Year Lifetime: Discovering Life in the Face of Death - David Carrier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nancy was still breathing, but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t wake her up.&lt;/strong&gt; For the first time since David first heard she had cancer, he thought she might really die. This is the wake up call of life; when you realize that it could end at any time. The next step is the most important. Will you live life in fear of death, or will you live life in appreciation for all you are given? This was the choice that Nancy and David had to make, in A Seven Year Lifetime. It answers the questions; how did they do it, and was it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This true story reveals how love can flourish, even against fatal odds. They knew Nancy had cancer and had only a few years to live. But they took the risk, anyway and fell in love, clinging to the belief they could enjoy what others have:&lt;strong&gt; the blessing of a full life.&lt;/strong&gt; And for seven years, they did.&lt;/p&gt;" />
