  <title>Recipes for Disease - Jp Grund</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recipes For Disease is an on-going series of books containing information on on-going research into the correlations between diet, disease and blood-type. The blueprint for this research is the book Eat Right For Your Type by Dr. Peter J. DAdamo. It is his research and his fathers discovery of the connection between antigens and lectins that made this newest facet of medicine possible.
Recipes For Disease came about as a result of over twenty-five years of observations in dealing with the aged, diseased and training people in gyms. I had always noticed right from the beginning that two people would have the same diet and exercise routine and yet come out with completely different results. I noticed right off that these people had different blood-types and I felt absolutely sure that was the answer. That was 1978.
Jump to 2005 when I discovered Dr. DAdamos book. With all the training information and health information I had gathered over the previous quarter-century, this book made everything fall into place. Combined with my experience over the years, I had quite the jump on the research to start with; I knew just about where to begin. So, I did. The statistical trends I started to see were astounding.
Now its 2008; three years later. I now have enough information to publish my initial findings and to show where this research is going. This is not about what you should do; instead, Recipes For Disease talks about what you should not do to achieve results to a healthier body. Succeeding books will have more information and new areas of research that are currently being investigated plus many we havent even begun to consider. Enjoy!
