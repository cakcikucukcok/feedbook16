      <meta name="description" content="The things real estate agent Mike P., a.k.a. Allen Pritchett, will show you in this book are the new ways of thinking, how to retire at a young age with these concepts, and also how to get multiple flows of income and how important it is. He has made suggestions on ways to make money easier with hard work and persistence. He also shows you why he doesnt use a 401(k) because there are more profitable and safer ways to invest, in his opinion. He will present to you a form of self-education that school doesnt teach. He shows you how he dropped out of school in eleventh grade, made bad choices, got in trouble, yet still was able to retire at the age of thirty-three, only working a day job for seven years of his entire life by using some of the principles in this book. He shows you the worst thing you can do is work for money. Own your own business. Become an entrepreneur.
Real estate agent Mike P. will show you that you can do it too. With a little motivation, persistence, determination, and education, he teaches." />
