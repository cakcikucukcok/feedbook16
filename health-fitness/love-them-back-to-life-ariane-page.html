  <title>Love Them Back to Life - Ariane Page</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;As the oak tree&lt;/b&gt; is  summarized in the acorn, so nature is summarized in the human brain. They express a model.  Looking at this small acorn though, no one can foresee the majestic oak tree it might become.  Of course, with only its genetic code it will not develop. In the same way, humans are called to become what our ancestors and even we cannot foresee. But in order to develop all our potentialities some conditions must be met. We surround this acorn with nutrients, water, earth, and light, allowing it to be part of a living whole. For humans, this living whole is nature and society.  Alas, at this time both have become deficient.  The model is not allowed to freely unfold.&lt;p&gt;
This model was intuitively grasped by all great traditions. It led psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung to find in Taoism principles so vast that they can be applied to the entire humanity.  With the rise of modern science though, this vision vanished. However, brain research results agree with the model so science is now on the brink of rediscovering it.&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Love them back to Life&lt;/i&gt;, her second book, Ariane Page takes us on a discovery journey through this model expressed by the human brain as she focuses on love. Love is the tool used by this model, the LIFE (Law Inherent to the Five Elements), to eventually lead us to coherence between our physical, emotional, mental, social, and spiritual realities. In that holism, we will truly feel alive, happy, and loved." />
