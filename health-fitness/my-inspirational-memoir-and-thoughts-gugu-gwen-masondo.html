  <title>My Inspirational Memoir and Thoughts - Gugu Gwen Masondo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gugu Gwen Masondo is a single parent to one son. She was rejected by her father and was raised by her distant relative of her mothers. Despite all the adversities she has faced growing up and in her journey to achieving her goals, she has conquered and has achieved her dreams because of her determination, courage, tenacity, and strong faith in God. In this book, she shares her thoughts and messages of encouragement and hope, which she strongly believes were all put in her spirit by God. She has been in bondage for forty-two years and was delivered in 2011. Her writings are inspired by her life experiences and her observations. She believes God has a great purpose for her life, taking into account all the incidents she has encountered and how her life has unfolded. She has touched some lives so far, mainly on Facebook, where she started with her writings. She has no intention whatsoever of causing conflict or confusion of any kind to the reader. It is entirely up to the reader whether they use the material in a way that would be beneficial to them or not. Her main objective and hope and prayer is to see and know that somebodys life somewhere has, in one way or the other, changed for the better through her memoir." />
