  <title>Finding Happiness with Aristotle as Your Guide - Geraldine Markel PhD, Gary Madvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Happiness is a basic human desire and one of the founding principles of the United States. Yet, it is something many find elusive, as well as a subject about which we have many questions. What fundamental truths will make us happy, even in turbulent times? Do we know why happiness seems out of reach? When our economic foundations are shaken, we may feel being happy belongs to the past, not the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Finding Happiness with Aristotle as Your Guide: Action Strategies Based on 10 Timeless Ideas,&quot; authors Gary Madvin and Geraldine Markel demonstrate how to deal with the problems of today and get back on the path to happiness. They provide vignettes of situations to which many can relate and show how the philosophical principles of Aristotle, one of the greatest thinkers of all time, can be used to move beyond the &lt;i&gt;stoppers&lt;/i&gt; to findingor rediscoveringhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether youre a businessperson, community leader, wage earner, or retiree, you can follow Aristotelian ideas for creating happiness in your life and never look back. The 10 ideas and action strategies show you how to take control and stop feeling empty, overwhelmed, confused, or dissatisfied-and start feeling fulfilled, satisfied, and certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.happinesswitharistotle.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.happinesswitharistotle.com&lt;/a&gt;" />
