  <title>Swept Under the Carpet - Carmel Schleger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Some women experience relief when they get the news that they need a hysterectomy.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But for Carmel Schleger it was an emotional blow. After all, getting your uterus surgically removed and in some cases, the fallopian tubes and ovaries, toois no small matter.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;She moved forward with the procedure, only because a female family member had had cervical cancer. Although her procedure was successful, she still found it invasive.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;That feeling was compounded by what she perceived as a lack of emotional validation, understanding, and support. When she searched online for a support group focused on helping women who had undergone a full or partial hysterectomy, she could find no such service.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;She shares her emotional journey in this memoir, revealing how she took control of her emotional health to rediscover happiness. In doing so, she developed numerous methods to promote healing, including art activities that she hopes will help others going through a similar experience.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If youre about to undergo or have undergone a partial or full hysterectomy, you are not alone. Find comfort, reassurance, and hope with the heartfelt lessons in &lt;i&gt;Swept Under the Carpet&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;" />
