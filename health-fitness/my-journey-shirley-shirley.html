  <title>My Journey - Shirley Shirley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With a grateful heart Shirley returned to an active life after her recovery from breast cancer.  Her collection of stories and poetry represent two years of journaling and spiritual growth. A rhythm of life is found in her writing where courage, faith, and joy abound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond her cancer reflections, she shares memories of her childhood and married life in Iowa and her recent move to Montana. She takes you from the prairies to sheep pastures to mountaintop experiences. Her love for biking, hiking, skiing, and scuba diving give you energy to explore your path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She hopes this story of survival and joy will encourage and strengthen her readers. The poems and stories are short and easy to read. Shirley, her husband Bob and their cat Bunny now live in the beautiful state of Montana.&lt;/p&gt;" />
