  <title>Unfolding the Lotus: Working the Fourth Step Through the Chakra System - Jeff Emerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unfolding the Lotus&lt;/i&gt; offers those who are on the recovery path a new and comprehensive tool on the path. This book takes the reader deep into themselves. It was written for those who have done conventional fourth steps in the past and are looking for something different and a way to uncover issues that are not covered in other fourth steps. However, anyone can read this book and get a lot out of it, even if they are not in recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insightful book shows us how our own lotus can grow out of the mud of addictions and attachments and how to help it unfold into a life of joyful freedom. Thank you, Jeff, for sharing your story and exploring what it means for our stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; David Loy, author of &lt;i&gt;Money, Sex, War, Karma; The World Is Made of Stories; and The Great Awakening&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a gem. The foundation of Opening the Lotus is Jeff Emersons own direct experience, and without a direct experience we cannot guide others on the path. He guides us in an open-hearted and honest way, interlinking the teachings with his own life story; this gives us hopehope of recovery from any addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
