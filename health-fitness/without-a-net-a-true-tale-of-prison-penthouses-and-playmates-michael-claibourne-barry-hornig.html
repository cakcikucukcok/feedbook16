  <title>Without a Net: A True Tale of Prison, Penthouses, and Playmates - Michael Claibourne, Barry Hornig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Starving and certain that I would die in my dingy jail cell in Spain, I made a deal with God. I fell to my knees, promising to give up all drugs and criminal activities. I prayed out loud, witnessed only by the urine-soaked walls and huge rats that shared my cage. My desperation was raw and naked. I thought about the Countess. I thought about my parents at home on Long Island. But mostly I thought about myself. &quot;Save me, God, and I will live virtuously and honor my family.&quot; I was released early and found myself back home, penniless and living in my parents&#39; basement.  God had kept his promise. I soon broke mine...  Without A Net is an autobiographical road trip through a volatile period of American history. Barry Hornig was a seeker and an explorer. His adventures were splendid and sordid, and the sort of stuff that would teach anyone a lesson. This is the story of how he learned his lessons the hard way." />
