  <title>Let&#39;s Talk about Sleep - Daniel A. Barone, Lawrence A. Armour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;News about sleep is everywhere we turn, and the statistics are numbing: Some 50-70 million Americans are affected by chronic sleep disorders and intermittent sleep problems; an estimated 30-35% of adults complain of insomnia; one in every 25 Americans takes a prescription sleep medication; more than a third of American adults don&amp;rsquo;t get enough sleep on a regular basis; sleep disorders account for an estimated $16 billion in medical costs each year, plus indirect costs due to missed days of work, decreased productivity and related factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And questions abound: why do we need to sleep at all? What happens when we sleep? What happens to the brain? We know the brain is active when we sleep, but what about the mind? And what are dreams? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An accessible and lively take on sleep, this book provides answers to those and other key questions. Along the way, it highlights the lessons a well-known neurologist has learned and what he shares with his patients on a daily basis. It discusses &amp;mdash; in terms everyone can understand &amp;mdash; what we know about sleep, what can go wrong with it, and what we can do to fix it. It also delves into what some of the great scientists and spiritual teachers have told us about sleep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is packed with useful information and suggestions that will improve all aspects of readers&amp;rsquo; lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
