Based on the authors&#39; own personal experiences and those of others, this book explores:
The four key behaviors of surviving and thriving
How to create the life you want from what you have
Developing the seven characteristics of the &#39;THRIVER&#39;
Cultivating these qualities in the midst of hardship, adversity, and failure 
How to &quot;put on&quot; courage in crisis
Tuning out negative self-talk and wrong thinking
Embracing the unexpected winds of change
How to recover and bounce back from trials" />
