  <title>The Compassionate Achiever - Christopher L. Kukk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;A powerful, practical guide for cultivating compassion&amp;#8212;the scientifically proven foundation for personal achievement and success at work, at home, and in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, we&amp;#8217;ve been told the key to prosperity is to look out for number one. But recent science shows that to achieve durable success, we need to be more than just achievers; we need to be compassionate achievers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research in biology, neuroscience, and economics have found that compassion&amp;#8212;recognizing a problem or caring about another&amp;#8217;s pain and making a commitment to help&amp;#8212;not only improves others&amp;#8217; lives; it can transform our own. Based on the most recent studies from a wide range of fields, &lt;em&gt;The Compassionate Achiever&lt;/em&gt; reveals the profound benefits of practicing compassion including more constructive relationships, improved intelligence, and increased resiliency. To help us achieve these benefits, Christopher L. Kukk, the founding Director of the Center for Compassion, Creativity and Innovation, shares his unique 4-step program for cultivating compassion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kukk makes clear that practicing compassion isn&amp;#8217;t about being a martyr or a paragon of virtue; it&amp;#8217;s about rejecting rage and indifference and choosing instead to be a thoughtful, caring problem-solver. He identifies the skills every compassionate achiever should master&amp;#8212;listening, understanding, connecting, and acting&amp;#8212;and outlines how to develop each, with clear explanations, easy-to-implement strategies, actionable exercises, and real-world examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;em&gt;The Compassionate Achiever&lt;/em&gt; everyone wins&amp;#8212;we can each achieve success in our own lives and create more productive workplaces, and healthier, less violent communities. &lt;/p&gt;" />
