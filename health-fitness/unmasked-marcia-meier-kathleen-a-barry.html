  <title>Unmasked - Marcia Meier, Kathleen A. Barry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Women over fifty are &amp;ldquo;the invisible woman&amp;rdquo; in American culture. In a society that reveres youth &amp;ndash; and particularly young, sexy women &amp;ndash; women over fifty fade into the shadows. Yet, for many women at mid-life, this is a time of flowering and coming into one&amp;rsquo;s own, sexually and otherwise. Many older women love sex and crave the intimacy it provides. For every story of a harried mother who turns her husband away at night, or the older woman who long ago lost her libido, there are legions of others whose sex drives match those of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study found that sixty percent of women fifty to fifty-nine were sexually active, that almost fifty percent of women in their sixties were sexually active, and nearly thirty percent of those over seventy were sexually active. So, why is so little attention paid to sex and intimacy among women in later life? Other than a smattering of magazine articles and some academic books, very little has been written about women, sex and intimacy. Oh, there are plenty of how-tos: advice on vaginal dryness and pain during sex and erectile dysfunction. But there is a dearth of work written by women about their sexual experiences after fifty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collection of essays and poetry is meant to bring sex after fifty for women into the open, to proclaim that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important, it is natural and healthy and, for some women, it is absolutely necessary. &lt;em&gt;Unmasked&lt;/em&gt; will surprise, inform, and&amp;mdash;it is hoped&amp;mdash;encourage all women of a certain age to (re)discover their sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
