  <title>The &#39;Real&#39; American Diet - Kevin C. Alston Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a culmination of the author&#39;s life, but mainly the past 10 years, where personal tragedies have led him to discover more about the correlation with food, nutrition &amp; the diseases of today, &amp; how it affects us all.  This program is an experiment of sorts, with the author using himself as the guinea pig, with positive results having been discovered, &amp; hopefully, in time, even bigger positive results yet to come.  Between our government &amp; Big Business, we, the people, are already involved in an experiment.  It&#39;s like a big laboratory.  With all of the harmful toxins that are allowed in our air, food, &amp;  water, diseases are at epidemic-like levels, &amp; the author, for one, would like to know if there is more to this than is being told to us. It speaks volumes when other nations refuse to accept grains &amp; meats from us, or at least it does to the author.  Most of the ailments we suffer from today emanate from our guts, &amp; our poor diets keep the sickness-wheels turning, costing each of us millions of dollars, a whole lot of heartache, pain, &amp; suffering.  It&#39;s time to make a change, &amp; that change started with the author&#39;s experiment on himself." />
