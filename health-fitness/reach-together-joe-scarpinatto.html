  <title>Reach Together - Joe Scarpinatto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joe Scarpinatto has studied in many different fields. And it was from these may different fields that the information presented here has evolved.
He came to a point in his life when he realized he no longer knew what was important. He had lost his life purpose. In response to this loss, he went on a twenty-year search to find his own answers. Finally, he realized that the answers we seek as human beings do not exist without; they exist within.
&lt;i&gt;Reach Together&lt;/i&gt; is an in-depth look into the mind of a man who found a path within himself that eventually led to a deeper understanding of our pasts, presents, and futures. The past and the future are now, in the present; therefore, we must act now and live now. There is no other timeno other placeto thrive and discover lifes meaning.
Scarpinattos collection of short essays and poems is deep and difficult at times. We do not often want to face the truth of our beings, but &lt;i&gt;Reach Together&lt;/i&gt; will guide you down a personal path to enlightenment. You will be left with feelings of well-being and inspiration. The time is now, as the entirety of your life exists within this single moment." />
