  <title>Sibling Grief - P. Gill White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;P. Gill White, PhD, has done an outstanding job of writing on a much-needed subject within the bereavement community. As siblings sadly are often the &quot;forgotten&quot; grievers when the death of their brother or sister occurs, a book such as this is greatly needed. Dr. White&#39;s insights and experiences as both a bereaved sibling herself and as a sibling grief counselor are sure to be a great help to all who read her book.&quot;&lt;strong&gt;-Patricia L. Moser, president of Bereaved Parents of the USA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A book for professional caregivers and grieving siblings alike.&quot;&lt;strong&gt;-Robert B. Simmonds, Ph.D., author of Emotional Wellness Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P. Gill White, PhD, was only fifteen when her sister Linda made her swear not to tell anyone about the pain she had in her side, fearing it would spoil an upcoming family vacation. Linda died four months later from a rare form of cancer. White and her family never talked about the loss until decades later, when memories began to haunt her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sibling Grief is White&#39;s validation of the emotional significance of sibling loss. She draws on both clinical experience and her own deeply personal experience, along with wisdom from hundreds of bereaved siblings, to explain the five healing tasks unique to sibling grief. White also describes the dream patterns of bereaved siblings, showing how healing is reflected in the dream state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout, she illustrates the long-lasting connection between siblings-a connection that death itself cannot sever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
