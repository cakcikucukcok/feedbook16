TESTIMONIAL Susan Alexandra The Property Millionaire 
&lt;p&gt;
&#39;I have been working with Karen for a few months now and found her to be a real inspiration. As a mentor Karen has gone to great efforts to understand me and my business, and demonstrates a real passion for enabling me to succeed. Karen gets you focused with clear actions and accountability for the way forward, whilst providing that supportive and guiding hand you need from a mentor. If you are serious about growing your business, I would definitely recommend you have Karen on board.&#39;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Karen Melonie Gould  now you add your own icing! LOVE PEACE AND HAPPINESS!
&lt;p&gt;
MENTORING  the cheery on top!

Details of the Recommendation: &quot;I had the pleasure of having Karen mentor me under the Rock star mentoring scheme. Karen is a highly professional and well experienced business woman with an impressive background. &lt;br&gt;
Through her mentoring Karen has helped me to move forward with my business. She has helped me maintain focus and has already exceeded my expectations in terms of her knowledge, contacts and willingness to get involved.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
