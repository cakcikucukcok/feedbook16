  <title>9 Things - Maggie Dent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is easy in our fast-paced, competitive, consumer-driven world to forget that children are not mini-adults, projects to be managed or problems to be solved. This common-sense guide to parenting and caring for children under eight, reminds us that a child’s development cannot be rushed, or crudely measured again milestones. It takes an entire childhood to grow and there is no perfect when it comes to parenting.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In her informed, heartfelt way, one of Australia’s favourite parenting authors Maggie Dent takes a comprehensive look at the 9 Things that truly matter in raising children, and why they matter so much. She uses the metaphor of a wise aunty, Wilma — a voice of ancient wisdom that seems to be disappearing amidst the chaos.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With passion, warmth and humour, Maggie draws on current research and her extensive experience as an educator, counsellor and mother of four to guide parents and caregivers in their endless decision-making, to raise children who are happy, healthy, strong, kind and resilient.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Commonly known as the ‘queen of common sense’, Maggie Dent has become one of Australia&#39;s favourite parenting authors and educators, with a particular interest in the early years, adolescence and resilience.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maggie’s experience includes teaching, counselling, and working in palliative care/funeral services and suicide prevention. She is a dedicated advocate to quietly changing lives in our families and communities. She is the mother of four sons and a very grateful grandmother.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maggie is the author of 11 books including her 2018 release &lt;i&gt;Mothering Our Boys&lt;/i&gt; which is already a bestseller." />
