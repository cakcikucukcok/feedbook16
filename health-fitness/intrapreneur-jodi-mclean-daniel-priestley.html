      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you an overworked and underpaid employee?&amp;nbsp; Do you fear for your job every single day, no matter the hours that you put in and the devotion that you show to your company?&amp;nbsp; This is the corporate culture that we will in.&amp;nbsp; You aren&amp;rsquo;t alone.&amp;nbsp; But, you are in control, whether you realize it or not. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, you will learn how to move up the corporate ladder instead of out the revolving door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everybody wants to be an entrepreneur.&amp;nbsp; I get that.&amp;nbsp; I don&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m a tremendous employee and I like to be part of a team.&amp;nbsp; Yet I&amp;rsquo;m not a typical employee&amp;hellip;and it you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, I bet you aren&amp;rsquo;t either. Something drew you to this book; the message attracts a specific reader. The kind of person who isn&amp;rsquo;t scared of hard work and long hours if it means you become part of something bigger.&amp;nbsp; And I don&amp;rsquo;t mean just the paycheck.&amp;nbsp; Although that will come along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this era of high corporate turnover, innovative and invaluable employees are never at risk. This is your step-by-step guide to become the star employee&amp;mdash;the INTRApreneur. During the age of the entrepreneur, there will always be a need for standout employees. Intrapreneurs who own their value and think like an entrepreneur will become the elite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process isn&amp;rsquo;t magic.&amp;nbsp; It isn&amp;rsquo;t complicated but it certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t easy&amp;hellip;but it will be worth it. And those who stay the course and follow the process will rise from a sea of mediocrity in the workplace. If you are a true intrepreneur, the kind of employee who can adopt an entrepreneur mindset in a corporate setting, you will grow from corporate obscurity to become your boss&amp;rsquo;s best hire.&amp;nbsp; You will become irreplaceable to the company, and you will become a coveted recruit by other companies who want to lure you away with fantastic new opportunities. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrapreneurs control their own destiny with grit, devotion and passion.&amp;nbsp; If this sounds like you, welcome to intrapreneurship.&amp;nbsp; This book will set you on your path to being a coveted, autonomous, high-valued and highly-paid intrapreneur.&lt;/p&gt;" />
