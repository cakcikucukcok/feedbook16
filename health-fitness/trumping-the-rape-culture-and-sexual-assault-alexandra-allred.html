  <title>Trumping The Rape Culture and Sexual Assault - Alexandra Allred</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In October 2017, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; ran an article about sexual abuse in Hollywood and just a few short weeks later, the legacy, career and name of director Harvey Weinstein were in ruins. For many, it was a celebration. The #MeToo movement was reborn in Twitter fever, but many more were left wondering why it had taken so long to bring this man down.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Furthermore, what about all the other powerful and not-so-powerful abusers who continue to sexually torment and violate their victims simply because they can? Why can&amp;rsquo;t we take them down with equal fervor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trumping the Rape Culture &amp;amp; Sexual Assault&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the first step to learning self-defense and taking a stand against the rape culture. As important as it is for women to learn how to protect ourselves, we must also stop making excuses for our abusers, societal norms, and media images of women as sexual objects. Using real-life scenarios described by alleged victims of Donald Trump, the book guides its readers through a &amp;ldquo;what would you do?&amp;rdquo; prevention course in sexual harassment and abuse and impresses the importance of such self-protection tactics as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Situational Awareness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; The most powerful weapon you have &amp;ndash; your voice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Understanding the real value (and practicality) of a self-defense course&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Walking tall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Fighting vs. compliance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have ever thought about taking a self-defense course but were too afraid or uncertain to make the commitment, this is your first and most important move. If you have been or are being sexually harassed and are uncertain as to what to do next, this is a must-read book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Alexandra Allred is a seasoned martial artist, former fighter and kickbox instructor. Having taught for over 30 years, Allred offers free self-defense classes and conducts seminars for women and girls, as well as those within the special needs and senior citizens populations because, as Allred says, predators are opportunists and opportunities are everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;" />
