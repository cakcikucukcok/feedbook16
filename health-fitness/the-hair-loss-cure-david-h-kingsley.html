  <title>The Hair-Loss Cure - David H. Kingsley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hair loss can have a devastating effect on peoples self-esteem. Its a condition that affects approximately 60 percent of women and 85 percent of men at some time in their lives. In The Hair-Loss Cure, author Dr. David H. Kingsley helps you find out why you are losing hair, helps you choose the right treatments, and helps you cope with the psychological and lifestyle problems often caused by losing your hair.&lt;p&gt;
As a hair-loss specialist who successfully battled his own hair loss, Dr. Kingsley reveals his expert insight into the causes and treatments of the condition.&lt;p&gt; 
The Hair-Loss Cure answers these questions:&lt;p&gt;
Are your really losing hair or just experiencing normal shedding?&lt;br&gt;
How do you cope with hair loss?&lt;br&gt;
What is causing your hair to fall out or thin?&lt;br&gt;
What treatments are available?&lt;br&gt;
How can you tell if the treatment is working?&lt;p&gt;
Most importantly, Dr. Kingsley shares information about hair-loss treatments that may slow the progression of the condition, stabilize it, or actually re-grow your hair. The Hair-Loss Cure can help you regain the control over your life that hair loss often takes away.&lt;p&gt;
