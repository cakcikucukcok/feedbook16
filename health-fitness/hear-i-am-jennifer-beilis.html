  <title>“Hear” I Am!! - Jennifer Beilis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I have my Associates degree in Social Sciences from Brookdale Community College in Lincroft, New Jersey, my Bachelors degree in Psychology from Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey and my Masters degree in Education and Deafness Rehabilitation, SCPI (Sign Language Profi ciency Interview) from New York University in New York.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She has weathered more storms than most people have that I have ever known. Yet, she still perseveres and conquers her fears, never letting an ounce of weakness tell her that she cannot do something... Because she knows that she can. Most of the struggles that I have seen, suffering alongside with her frequently as she has fallen down only to pick herself up. Hear I am!! Is like poetry to the poet as medicine is to the patient. Every reader will relate to something somewhere in the book. Each time it is read, it will even relate to the same person differently as they progress through various challenges in their life. I wish Jen many years of continued success in her relationships, employment, overcoming obstacles with her health and wellness, financial security, and in her continuation to showing others that there is always hope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;P.S. College graduate in New Jersey&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may contact me through Facebook on heariam_jennifer or on&lt;/p&gt;
