  <title>Mum, Alzheimer&#39;s and Me - Caroline Court</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone who has a friend or family member with Alzheimer&#39;s in a nursing home should read this book. It provides a close look at the challenges faced not only by the people who suffer from Alzheimer&#39;s but also, just as importantly, by the people (including nursing home staff) who care about them. This book reveals much that is true about this disease and about caregivers- and the truth is often funny and always wearing. Court has addressed a painful subject but the book is a compelling read despite the hard truths. 
... R. Dixon, WI 
We all live afraid of Alzheimer&#39;s--afraid that one day we will lose our mind to the disease or perhaps worse, that one we love will be afflicted. Caroline Court has written an achingly honest story of one woman&#39;s affliction and its devastating impact on the lives of those around her. Anyone who has ever cared for someone in a nursing home will immediately recognize the terrible dilemmas and compromises imposed by nursing care. A lively read, clever, and above all else, thought-provoking. this story will stay with you long after you close the cover on the last page. 
... In Memphis, TN 
My sister is an advanced Alzheimer&#39;s patient who because of travel distance and difficulties I am only able to visit about once a year. I try to help a little by bringing back memories of our happy youth and family life together. However, this book brought home to me the time, effort, and love, some of it thankless, which is required of the immediate family and the professional staff and caregivers in the nursing home. I would recommend this book to those who wish a deeper insight into the wider but also detailed aspects of this tragic disease.
