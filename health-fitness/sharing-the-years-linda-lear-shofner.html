  <title>Sharing the Years - Linda Lear Shofner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kaye Mason has found the love of her life and is planning a wedding and a new life. It is a far different life from what she had expected, but she finds that the quiet country back roads of Kentucky life hold more joy than she could have anticipated. Her family is there along with newfound friends to support her during her first year of teaching, which proves to hold more problems than she could ever have imagined. All the problems of living an educator&#39;s life seem to be hurled at her during her first year on the job. Then the reappearance of Chris, her former fianc, raises more tension. This is a book about life and you will see yourself in one of the characters whether it is Kaye embarking on a new career and a marriage, or her parents facing all the problems of being a baby boomer, or her aging grandparents having to be supportive while facing their problems of aging. But the Mason family faces the problems together with a lot of love and respect. They show us all why supportive families are so important. You might even see yourself as a young child in some of the children Kaye must try to teach. Children appear each day in classrooms everywhere trying to learn while loaded with the problems they must face in their families. Kaye&#39;s attachment to her students shows us that teaching is much more than preparing lesson plans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
