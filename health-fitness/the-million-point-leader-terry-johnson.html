One will say that leaders face adversity with fortitude; another will say that a great leader conducts effective and productive meetings; another will say that leaders have virtue, ambition, or imagination.  But you and I have seen people in leadership positions who are incredibly smart, others who manage meetings with great finesse, and others who have mastered important skills, but yet cannot command a following. We have also seen people who have none of those traits and yet have tremendous supporters.
