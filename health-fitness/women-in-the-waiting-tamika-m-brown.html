      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gods plan is for a marriage to last forever. When one spouse is saved and the other is not, it can result in one or both individuals wanting to call it quits. If you ever felt like your personal experience of being married to an unbeliever was one in a million, this book seeks to encourage you. You are not alone. It is time to stop feeling like you are alone and allow this book to give you realistic, biblical principles that can change your life. As Christians, we dont like to talk about the roller coaster of emotions and the desire to walk out of our marriage. Instead, we choose to suffer silently and pray that it will pass quickly. This book speaks to your inner thoughts and experiences and instructs you through the Word of God, how to become an overcomer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
