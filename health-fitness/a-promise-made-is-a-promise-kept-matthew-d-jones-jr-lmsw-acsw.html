  <title>A Promise Made Is a Promise Kept - Matthew D. Jones Jr. Lmsw Acsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A must-read, it is clear and complete for those contemplating marriage for the first time. It is very informative and discusses the important factors of having a blessed and meaningful marriage. It challenges ones thinking in a blunt way.&lt;/p&gt;
 Tracy Taylor&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been married since April, 1973, and wish I had read an insightful book like this. Its a comprehensive yet concise focus of an important and complicated subject. A book of candor, practicality, and precision. Ill be recommending it to both of my children and anyone I know who is planning to get married.&lt;/p&gt;
 Myra Tucker&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is powerful, profound, and comprehensive. It connects the history of marriage with the current institution we have inherited. It is well documented that half of all marriages may end in divorce, but love still prevails. This book, if read with an open and honest mind, could no doubt have a positive impact on improving the survival of marriages as we know it today. I highly recommend the book.&lt;/p&gt; Wes Johnson&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is done in a thoughtful and sensitive manner on such an important issue. Marriage is the most important decision two people will make in life. Why? Because you are partners for life. Matt 19:5:6 says, and they twain shall be one flesh. Wherefore, they are no more twain, but one flesh. Prayer and good communication is very important for a marriage to last.&lt;/p&gt;
