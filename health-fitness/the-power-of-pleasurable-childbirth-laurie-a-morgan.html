	The crucial differences between normal, physiological birth and &quot;assisted&quot; childbirth&lt;/p&gt;
	How to free yourself from unnecessary worry and fear about childbirth&lt;/p&gt;
	How to simplify your approach to childbirth for the greatest safety and enjoyment&lt;/p&gt;
	The truth about midwifery and obstetrics, and how dependence on experts may pose needless risk to you and your baby&lt;/p&gt;
	The surprisingly bright side of personal responsibility&lt;/p&gt;
	Common stumbling blocks along the path to a joyful birth experience&lt;/p&gt;" />
