  <title>The Broken Self - Ingrid B. Brouwer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever felt youre not enough? 
Do you find your constantly analysing yourself?
Do you continually asked Why am I always anxious and depressed?  
Are you tired of seeing therapist after therapist and getting nowhere?
Are you sick of the same old self help books filled with exercises that dont work?
Worn out with trying to find the answer to your happiness?
Then Stop Struggling!
The answer is so simple. It lies within yourself! What do you mean within yourself? Where?  I cant see it. If its true I wouldnt be in this mess, I can hear you say.    Fortunately, it is true.  Why do I say fortunately because the answer is so clear when you discover it.  You have just forgotten it, by looking for answers externally, always searching but never finding. 
This book helps you find that one answer, bringing it to your full awareness and embracing it through self love and acceptance and perhaps for the first time hearing your inner self louder than the demons that haunted you for years. In doing so you will gain your own power and not the inner critic that has continually plagued you. By losing self-doubt and building self-esteem you will become the captain and master of your soul, writing your own life script and not some outside influence that doesnt fit with your inner being. Most of all it is you that will be loved by your own self and stand not so much as tall but as calm and peaceful in your own world that you wish to create and live ridding yourself of struggle, anxiety and depression forever." />
