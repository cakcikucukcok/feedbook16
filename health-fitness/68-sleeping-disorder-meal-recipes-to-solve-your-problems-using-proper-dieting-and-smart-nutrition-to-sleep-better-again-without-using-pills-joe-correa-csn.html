  <title>68 Sleeping Disorder Meal Recipes to Solve Your Problems : Using Proper Dieting and Smart Nutrition to Sleep Better Again Without Using Pills - Joe Correa CSN</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you notice any of the following symptoms, then  you probably have some sort of sleep disorder: -   have trouble sleeeping at night -    waking up with a feeling of fatigue after seven or eight hours of sleep -    spontaneously falling asleep during meetings and social events -    the unpleasant feeling of crawling and tingling in the feet followed by an irresistible urge to move your legs -    very loud snoring and restless sleep  About 60% of people in the world sleep between six and eight hours a day, 36% sleep more than eight hours a day, while less than 4% sleep less than six hours. Both, men and women have the same need for sleep.  Unfortunately, our modern lifestyle is fast which means a lot of people have little or no time for sleeping. Combined with unhealthy eating habbits and stress, this can become a serious problem. If you wake up tired and are sleep deprived, this could be the first indication of having a sleeping disorder." />
