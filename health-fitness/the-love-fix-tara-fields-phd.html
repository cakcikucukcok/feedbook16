  <title>The Love Fix - Tara Fields, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All couples argue, but how do some couples get to what seems like the point of no return?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licensed marriage and family therapist Dr. Tara Fields has spent more than twenty-eight years working with couples, and she has discovered that there are five common conflict loops that couples fall into&amp;#8212;and three steps to getting past having the same fights over and over again and onward to building a relationship where each partner feels heard, understood, respected, and loved. These steps include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Recognizing the conflict loop at play&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Exploring past and present fears&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Creating opportunities to get in touch with the deepest needs of both partners in order to find new gratitude, respect, and trust&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change comes with awareness. When you&amp;#8217;re present in the moment, conflict with your partner can become an opportunity to work through unresolved issues and to learn more about each other; it can even become a way to grow closer. In &lt;em&gt;The Love Fix, &lt;/em&gt;Fields shares her tested and proven tools to help build stronger relationships, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Insight from real couples who have repaired their relationships&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Self-assessment quizzes to get to the root of the problem&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Practical 3-Minute Fixes you can start using immediately&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  HEARTwork exercises to help you dig deeper in order to reconnect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s never too late to reignite your passion and to restore the love between you and your partner. Stop rehashing the same issues, figure out what you&amp;#8217;re &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;fighting about, and start enjoying a happier, stronger relationship today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
