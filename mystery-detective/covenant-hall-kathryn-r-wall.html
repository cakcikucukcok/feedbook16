  <title>Covenant Hall - Kathryn R. Wall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Private Investigator Bay Tanner is hired by a young mother desperate to locate her estranged family. Joline Eastman&#39;s daughter is dying of leukemia, and all other sources for a bone-marrow transplant have been exhausted. A yellowing photograph and a handful of wartime letters are the only clues she has to offer. But it&#39;s what she&#39;s &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;willing to share that may hold the ultimate solution to saving her daughter&#39;s life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bay has her own family to worry about. A phone call from Lavinia Smalls, her aging father&#39;s companion and caretaker, sends her rushing to the hospital. A few, whispered words, uttered in a moment of semi-conscious confusion, shatter her world and launch Bay on a quest that will redefine everything she thought she knew about herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battling time, Bay and her late husband&#39;s brother, sheriff &#39;s sergeant Red Tanner, search desperately for Joline&#39;s missing family, only to discover that an old murder and a haunted woman from Bay&#39;s past may hold the key to everything.&lt;/p&gt;" />
