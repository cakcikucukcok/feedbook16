Finally, they are employed by a Santa Monica woman to discover what her husband has been concealing from her. When the man is murdered outside of a West Los Angeles bar, however, Sam and Mike find themselves taking on much more than they bargained for. As they try to keep their client safe and to determine who had killed her husband, they travel to San Francisco, where Sam encounters many ghosts of his past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this mystery novel, two recently divorced middle-aged men become private detectives and are soon involved in a murder investigation while protecting their client.&lt;/p&gt;" />
