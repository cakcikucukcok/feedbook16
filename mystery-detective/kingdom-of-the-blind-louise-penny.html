But what if, Gamache begins to ask himself, she was perfectly sane? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a body is found, the terms of the bizarre will suddenly seem less peculiar and far more menacing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it isn&#39;t the only menace Gamache is facing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The investigation into what happened six months ago--the events that led to his suspension--has dragged on, into the dead of winter.
