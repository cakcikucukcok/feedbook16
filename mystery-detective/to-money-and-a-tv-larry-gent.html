  <title>To Money and a TV - Larry Gent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My nameis Benedict Thompson and I am a superhero. WIth a single touch I can read an item&amp;#39;s past. I can tell you who used that pen before you, I can desribe how that shoe was made and I can describe everything that has been done on that motel bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every superpower is a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benedict has never been the same since coming home from Iraq but he&amp;#39;s getting better. He&amp;#39;s rejoined the lives of his family, he&amp;#39;s keeping busy with work, he has a kinda-sorta-but-not-really girlfriend and his Netflix queue has just expanded. Everything is coming up Benedict.&lt;br /&gt;
When an evil movie-quoting sniper starts taunting him over the phone, Benedict gets worried.&lt;br /&gt;
When the sniper starts killing people and leaving items from Benedict&amp;#39;s past at the crime scene, Benedict gets scared.&lt;br /&gt;
When his kinda-sorta-but-not-really girlfriend wants to have the relationship talk, Benedict gets terrified.&lt;br /&gt;
Benedict already misses his TV.&lt;/p&gt;" />
