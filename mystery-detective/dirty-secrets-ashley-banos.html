  <title>Dirty Secrets - Ashley banos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dirty Secrets?  What would you say is a clean secret? And can you keep a secret?  Stephanies secret was not an ordinary secret and its definitely not one that you want to tell anyone else about. Stephanie tried keeping her secret to herself but it seemed that her closet was too full with skeletons and they began to all fall out. As Stephanie says, A secret is only safe if you are the only one who knows what it is. 
Some secrets are better left kept as a secret; this is what Stephanie has learned a lot about. Before her big move to her new apartment she lived miles away in a small town where everyone knew everyones business. If you walked out of your house to go down the street, the whole town knew exactly where you were. But Stephanie had a lot of secrets and no one would have ever known that she had been hiding them.
Stephanie was exhausted from the move and all of the unpacking made her extremely tired. There were so many things that still had to be done. She looked around and saw boxes that still needed to be put away. She spotted a small red box. She reached down and picked it up. With so many boxes she packed, she couldnt remember exactly what was in that particular box. She ripped the tape off of the box and opened it. Tears started to fall from her eyes.
Sometimes there are too many skeletons in one closet and they all start falling out. A secret is only safe if you are the only one who knows what it is." />
