  <title>Before She Knew Him - Peter Swanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catching a killer is dangerous&amp;#8212;especially if he lives next door&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the hugely talented author of &lt;em&gt;The Kind Worth Killing&lt;/em&gt; comes an exquisitely chilling tale of a young suburban wife with a history of psychological instability whose fears about her new neighbor could lead them both to murder . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hen and her husband Lloyd have settled into a quiet life in a new house outside of Boston, Massachusetts. Hen (short for Henrietta) is an illustrator and works out of a studio nearby, and has found the right meds to control her bipolar disorder. Finally, she&amp;#8217;s found some stability and peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when they meet the neighbors next door, that calm begins to erode as she spots a familiar object displayed on the husband&amp;#8217;s office shelf. The sports trophy looks exactly like one that went missing from the home of a young man who was killed two years ago. Hen knows because she&amp;#8217;s long had a fascination with this unsolved murder&amp;#8212;an obsession she doesn&amp;#8217;t talk about anymore, but can&amp;#8217;t fully shake either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could her neighbor, Matthew, be a killer? Or is this the beginning of another psychotic episode like the one she suffered back in college, when she became so consumed with proving a fellow student guilty that she ended up hurting a classmate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more Hen observes Matthew, the more she suspects he&amp;#8217;s planning something truly terrifying. Yet no one will believe her. Then one night, when she comes face to face with Matthew in a dark parking lot, she realizes that he knows she&amp;#8217;s been watching him, that she&amp;#8217;s really on to him. And that this is the beginning of a horrifying nightmare she may not live to escape. . . &lt;/p&gt;" />
