  <title>The Grooming Stage: Selection Process - J. Ashlock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She was once a southern, trailer-trash plaything for her abusive step-father to patronize. Today, Nicky Keenly is a relaxed, hard-core, confident professional with a booming million dollar thoroughbred company. She has the reins on things around her and control of her own life, now... or at least she thinks she does. Her perfect life, still isn&#39;t enough to keep this investigator retired for long. After taking a case in her home town, Nicky finds that the longer she remains, the more she reverts back to an unstable past she had buried years ago. Locked away memories are crawling back into her flawless world with a vengeance. She begins to question, not only her cognitive abilities to complete her self-assigned duties, but whether or not she has EVER had a grip on her own reality or completely healed from a past that has haunted her subconsciously her entire life. Even she is unsure of who she is truly chasing?" />
