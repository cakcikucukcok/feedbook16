  <title>The Caliphate - Anna Erishkigal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eisa McCarthy lives in Caliphate City under the control of the radical Islamic group, the Ghuraba. Seven years ago General Mohammad bin-Rasulullah defeated the United States in a ruthless betrayal and set up their worldwide Caliphate in the ruins of Washington, D.C. The Ghuraba&amp;#39;s supreme holy leader, the Abu al-Ghuraba, claims Eisa&amp;#39;s father gave him control of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, a claim bolstered by the smoldering ashes of many cities and her Syrian-born mother&amp;#39;s testimony. But after her mother is accused of apostasy, she learns her father may not be the &amp;#39;martyr&amp;#39; the Ghuraba claim.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do the Ghuraba really possess the launch codes for the ICBM missiles? Or did her father &amp;#39;lock them out&amp;#39; as Colonel Everhart, the rebel commander, wants her to tell the world? If she fights, the Ghuraba will kill her little sister, but if she doesn&amp;#39;t, eventually the Ghuraba will hack in and nuke them all. All Eisa has are a string of Muslim prayer beads and a pre-Islamic myth her father told her the night he disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fate of the world, and her little sister&amp;#39;s life, hang in the balance as Eisa sorts through ancient myth, her Muslim faith, and what really happened the night the Ghuraba seized control." />
