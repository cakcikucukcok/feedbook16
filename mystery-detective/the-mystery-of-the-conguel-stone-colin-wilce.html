  <title>The Mystery of the Conguel Stone - Colin Wilce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Baxter family had always enjoyed their holidays in France. Well they did until they visited Le Camping de le Plage on the tip of the Quiberon Peninsula in Southern Brittany. When James Baxter picked up an eel shaped stone off the Plage du Conguel and passed it to his Dad, Ralph, he could not have foreseen the mystery and adventure that would follow them around during the following twelve months until they made their inevitable return to the area.  With stone in pocket, Ralph had left his family to walk out to the very tip of the Quiberon Peninsula only to experience what he deemed to be a deathly experience that affected his mental state until he was able to return and solve the Mystery of the Conguel Stone.  A year full of strange characters, mysterious events, disbelieving wife and daughter and a determination to solve the mystery leads to a surprising resolution to what did actually happen to Ralph on the Peninsula." />
