  <title>Jena Parker Returns - Betty Swem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jena Parker is determined to find the answers that will help her put her horrible past behind her, but what she discovers may take her further into the darkness. Shes become an unstoppable force, and those who are smart will stay out of her way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jena was once a young, innocent girl whose only dreams were to live a simple teenagers life, go to college, and share her love with her best friend, Jake Paterson. Fate, however, had other plans for her. Now shes caught up in a world wind of turmoil, trying to find her way back to the girl she once knewbut that girl may be lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a short time, her life has changed. Her father has been murdered, and her mother is dead as well. The revenge she sought in finding and killing Mr. McNeilthe man she blames for unleashing her dark sideis not enough to stop the rage that boils within.
Whats more, theres a secret from her past of which she remains unaware. Mystery still surrounds the event that robbed her of her innocence, and she must discover who did it and make them pay. The past collides with the present, and lies circle around them both as Jena finds herself once again deep in love, betrayed, and force to commit murder. Only time will tell whether Jena will find redemption, or whether her destiny has been sealed by the cold rage that lives deep within her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
