  <title>The West Side Kid - Valentine Cardinale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lorne Bennett used to be a quite famous movie star, until that fateful day when his wife was found murdered in their Manhattan apartment and he became the prime suspect. Unable to provide an adequate alibi, &quot;The West Side Kid,&quot; as he is known to his fans, felt forced to flee and leave his baby daughter Laura behind with her aunt and uncle. Twenty-two years later, he is still on the run, unaware that Laura, now grown and working as an advertising copywriter in New York City, has become so obsessed with learning as much as she can about her parents she launches her own investigation into the murder and her father&#39;s role in it. Against the advice of police and relatives, she throws herself into the cold case and picks up some valuable information. Gradually, the pieces start coming together, but the more she learns, the more her life and the lives of others are endangered.
Here&#39;s what reviewers are saying about The West Side Kid:
For Reader Views, reviewer Olivera Baumgartner-Jackson defines Cardinale&#39;s writing as &quot;definitely imaginative and engaging, with a fast-moving story, wild twists and turns and an interesting ending. His characters are well defined and thoroughly believable The villains are appropriately repugnant and the good guys dashing and daring.&quot; Her favorite character is twelve-year-old Alex Volpe, whose &quot;keen powers of observation and charming personality were a true asset in the quest for the truth.&quot; The reviewer hopes that she, along with Alex&#39;s father (Billy) and Laura, &quot;appear in some kind of a sequel or spin-off story in the near future.&quot; Finally, this comment: &quot;I feel certain that The West Side Kid by Valentine Cardinale will be enjoyed by readers everywhere.&quot; 
Midwest Book Rerview, focusing on Lorne Bennett&#39;s plight, calls attention to the role  that fear plays in people&#39;s lives, making &quot;you flee from everything, including the ones you love.&quot; The West Side Kid is &quot;an entertaining thriller, and highly recommended reading.&quot;  
ForeWord Clarion Review likes the way &quot;Cardinale skillfully throws suspicion on a series of individuals as Laura is repeatedly warned by a mysterious caller not to get involved in the investigation.&quot; This reviewer also thinks that &quot;Alex&#39;s sleuthing produces nice touches&quot; and notes that &quot;the author has left open the door for sequels&quot; featuring several characters, including the precocious Alex. &quot;Cardinale&#39;s fast-paced and imaginative twists and turns should keep his fans asking for more.&quot;  
Sacramento Book Review calls The West Side Kid &quot;a well-written novel with plenty to recommend. While it is a mystery story, it is also the search for meaning and roots. Laura needs to lay her own ghosts to rest about her family and the abandonment she&#39;s felt all her life. And her resolution provides her not only an answer to that early mystery, but also peace with her life. A quick and enjoyable story.&quot;" />
