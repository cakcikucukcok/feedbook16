  <title>Lesser Minds - Matthew Clairmont</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fresno State is a school of academics, athletics, and now, a terrible secret. Two young men have been mysteriously murdered on campus in December 2002, and their alleged killer, Michael Enslow, is a reclusive and clearly disturbed student who refuses to cooperate. Two detectives have the misfortune of reviewing the case and meet with Enslow, but after each fruitless encounter they turn to his mentor to shed some light.&lt;/P&gt;
David Wilkins is an accomplished psychology professor with big ambitions and an attitude to match. His vision for Enslow is grandiose and extreme, and his faith in the young man&#39;s potential is relentless. With his pride and reputation at stake, he constantly obstructs the detectives in an attempt to keep them from the disturbing truth.&lt;/P&gt;
But it&#39;s a truth that Enslow himself has set in motion; a truth that is released in small fragments, leaving the detectives to the unenviable task of completing the puzzle.&lt;/P&gt;
Who killed Barker and Amahd? Why? And what, what, is &lt;I&gt;Lesser Minds&lt;/I&gt;?&lt;/P&gt;" />
