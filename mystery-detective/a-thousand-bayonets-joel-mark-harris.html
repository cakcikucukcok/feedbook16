  <title>A Thousand Bayonets - Joel Mark Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upon returning from Afghanistan, journalist John Webster discovers a gang war in his backyard. Now he must find a way to survive in this Canadian warzoneor die in the crossfire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Webster has seen the terrible things human beings can do. Hes an experienced investigative journalist, recently returned from the war in Afghanistan. John saw hell over there; he looked death straight in the face. He is glad to be back to the normalcy of his Canadian homethat is, until he realizes there is a war brewing in his own backyard, and peace is a word no longer spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John gets caught up in the battle between two of the most powerful and murderous criminal gangs in the city. Using what he learned on the foreign battlefields, he stays alive, despite the price on his head. The only way to save his own life is to find the man responsible for the brutal neighborhood bloodshed. When the police slap a subpoena on him, though, John finds his only solace on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, John is back in a warzone, fighting for his life. Will he be able to stop the bloodthirsty crime lords? The flashbacks to Afghanistan threaten to pull John into darkness. Soon, the past and present collide, and he cant tell which way is up or down. The need for redemption may be stronger than the need for survival as John Webster finds himself on his most dangerous assignment yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
