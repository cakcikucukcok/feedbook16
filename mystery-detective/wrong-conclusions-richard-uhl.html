  <title>Wrong Conclusions - Richard Uhl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tom Tyler, a salesman for a food service company, doesn&#39;t believe in luck. For twenty-five years, he&#39;s worked hard to achieve success at his job and in his marriage, even resisting the temptation to have an affair with a beautiful co-worker. &lt;p&gt;
But Tom&#39;s luck is about to change. After discovering his car has been stolen, he stumbles into the underbelly of Chinatown, where a violent underworld thrives. All he wants to do is get to a police station, but before he can, two thugs confront him on a quiet side street.  Tom barely escapes the encounter as a man known only as Fong, a Chinese gang leader, watches from the shadows. When Fong sees Tom enter a police station, he assumes the worst and orders him killed. &lt;p&gt;
Now, Tom finds himself battling for his life. Likewise, so does Ming Yee Lin, an illegal immigrant who Fong has snuck into the country and enslaved. &lt;p&gt;
To free themselves from the gang, both Tom and Lin will need some breaks to start going their way. Otherwise, they will find themselves dead because of &lt;i&gt;Wrong Conclusions&lt;/i&gt;." />
