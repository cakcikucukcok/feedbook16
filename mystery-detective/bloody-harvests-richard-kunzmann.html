  <title>Bloody Harvests - Richard Kunzmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Even your soul isn&#39;t safe in death...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of shimmering Johannesburg, Detective Harry Mason and his crew are summoned to a grisly crime scene. By all accounts, discovering the mutilated corpse of a young child is a horrific and heart-wrenching task. But in the South African city, where some citizens still cling to the nation&#39;s mythological past, there is much more at stake.&lt;br&gt;            Mason and his team must discover whether this gruesome death is the work of a serial killer on the loose; or the work of a cult leader practicing a tribal muti killing---in which children are sacrificed for their body parts in order to elicit powerful &quot;medicine.&quot;  Discerning between the two is even more complicated than it seems, especially in a city rife with cultural and social tensions---and they&#39;re sure the killer will strike again.&lt;br&gt;            Mason&#39;s police partner, Jacob Tshabalala, is also faced with his own questions. Both a tribesman and a cop, he is forced to reconsider his beliefs as he becomes increasingly convinced that this time they are dealing with a genuine witch---perhaps one powerful enough to subvert the investigation itself. The two friends&#39; relationship deteriorates as the case progresses and cultural tensions grow between them. They are still no closer to identifying the killer when a second murder occurs.  &lt;br&gt;            Meanwhile Nina Reading, a young reporter, has been conducting her own investigation into slave trafficking, thus putting herself in deadly danger. Harry&#39;s discoveries and Nina&#39;s revelations unite and lead them ever deeper into a chilling spiritual underworld in the slums of Johannesburg, where money, superstition, and fear reign supreme. But their enemies will stop at nothing to protect their bloody harvests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Praise for &lt;i&gt;Bloody Harvests&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kunzmann has a seasoned and individual voice.&quot;---&lt;i&gt;Publishing News &lt;/i&gt;(UK)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Bloody Harvests&lt;/i&gt; is a valuable addition to the South African canon.
