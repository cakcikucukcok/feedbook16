  <title>Haunting Echoes - Mai Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Clarrie&amp;rsquo;s familiarity with the &amp;ldquo;Other Side&amp;rdquo; is about to become far more intimate than she has ever wanted. Her mother, Sarah is too distraught to care what else is happening, so it is left to their friend Polly to work out whether Amy&amp;rsquo;s fall from the car park was suicidal, or something more sinister.
