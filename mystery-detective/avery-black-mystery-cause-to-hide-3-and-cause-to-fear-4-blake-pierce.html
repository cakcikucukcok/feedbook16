  <title>Avery Black Mystery: Cause to Hide (#3) and Cause to Fear (#4) - Blake Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A dynamic story line that grips from the first chapter and doesn&#39;t let go.&quot; &lt;p&gt;--Midwest Book Review, Diane Donovan (regarding Once Gone) &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From #1 bestselling mystery author Blake Pierce comes a new masterpiece of psychological suspense. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bundle of books #3 (CAUSE TO HIDE) and #4 (CAUSE TO FEAR) in Blake Pierce&#39;s Avery Black Mystery series! This bundle offers books three and four in one convenient file, with over 120,000 words of reading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CAUSE TO HIDE, bodies are being found in the outskirts of Boston, their corpses burned beyond recognition, as the police realize a new serial killer is roaming the streets. As the media converges and the pressure is upped, the Boston Police Department must turn to its most brilliant-and controversial-homicide detective: Avery Black. Avery, still trying to pick up the pieces of her own life-her budding relationship with Ramirez, her reconciliation with Rose-suddenly finds herself thrown into the most challenging case of her career.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CAUSE TO FEAR, when a body turns up floating beneath the frozen Charles River, the Boston Police summons its most brilliant and controversial homicide detective-Avery Black-to close the case. It doesn&#39;t take Avery long, however, to realize that this is no isolated murder: it is the work of a serial killer. Other bodies begin to turn up, all of them sharing one thing in common: all are trapped in ice. Is it all a coincidence-or the signature of a particularly deranged killer? As the media converges and Avery suffers pressure from her bosses, she struggles to crack the inexplicable case, too bizarre even for her brilliant mind. At the same time she tries to keep her own depression at bay, as her personal life spirals to a new low. And she does it all while trying to enter the mind of a psychotic and elusive killer.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark psychological thrillers with heart-pounding suspense, the AVERY BLACK MYSTERY series is a riveting new series-with a beloved new character-that will leave you turning pages late into the night. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book #5 in the Avery Black series will be available soon." />
