  <title>Curiosity Killed the Cat Sitter - Blaize Clement</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Until three years ago, Dixie Hemingway was a deputy with the Sarasota County Sherriff&#39;s Department in southwest Florida. Then came a tragic accident. Now Dixie&#39;s a pet-sitter on Siesta Key, a lush, exotic barrier island where the people tend to be rich, suntanned, and tolerant of one another&#39;s quirks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dixie tried to get her life back in order, pet-sitting is the perfect job. She goes into people&#39;s homes while they&#39;re gone and takes care of their pets; she likes the animals, they like her, and she doesn&#39;t have to deal with people very much. She especially does not have to be afraid that she&#39;ll run into a situation that will cause her to lose her hard-won composure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Dixie finds a man bizarrely drowned in a cat&#39;s water bowl, she is drawn into a tangled web of danger and secrets. Unbeknownst to Lieutenant Guidry, the homicide detective handling the murder, Dixie begins her own investigation into the whereabouts of the cat&#39;s owner, who has now vanished. Fans of &lt;i&gt;The Cat Who...&lt;/i&gt; book series by Lilian Jackson Braun will adore this riveting new pet-oriented sleuth and will eagerly await Dixie&#39;s next case: Will duplicity dog the dachshund?&lt;/p&gt;" />
