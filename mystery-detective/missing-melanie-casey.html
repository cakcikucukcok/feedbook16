Still haunted by her last run-in with a serial killer, Cass Lehman is trying hard to focus on the future. That’s not easy when she has the ‘gift’ of retrocognition … the ability to spontaneously re-live the last minutes of a person’s life.  
Cass and Detective Ed Dyson are now trying to make a normal home together, but when she gets entangled in Ed’s latest case things are far from normal.
A twisted tale of love, desperation and murder ... When the psychic meets the psychotic, who will come out unscathed?The 3rd book in the critically acclaimed Cass Lehman Psychic Series. A reluctant psychic, a troubled detective… and a deeply twisted serial killer.
