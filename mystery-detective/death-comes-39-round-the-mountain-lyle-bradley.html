James Emerson, co-manager of radio station GBS, has agreed to bring the staff to a dude ranch, owned by tycoon Judd Eben, as a new publicity ploy.

During a sharpshooting competition Eben is killed, and each shooter seems to have a motive to have murdered him. As the staff tries to help the local sheriff, Jasper Worden, uncover the truth of his death, someone ramps up the attempts on Melvin&#39;s life. Will the GBS staff uncover the truth before the killer is successful in his attempts? Or will Melvin find himself six feet under?" />
