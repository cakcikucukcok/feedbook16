  <title>Lilith’S Reflection - Brigitte Wynn Karey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Liliths Reflection explores the concept of possibilities rather than facts. If facts dominate most of our daily thinking, wed leave out possibilities that might exist in our livesthe unseen from other dimensions that intercept our paths of life. Things or events exist for a reason, and there is more than one way to look into every situation.
Lilith was introduced as an orphan and a tragic victim who was abandoned by her psychopathic father at the age of six. She was mentally not well, she thought at first. Now she realized her condition has never been that simple. Her illness wasnt strong enough to poison her mind, but something else was. Her mental illness was just the image she portrayed to others, but her true self was far beyond her sickness. 
Love, in this novel, is represented in an unnoticeable and unusual way rather than in a traditional way. There is no such thing as the correct or the wrong way of loving someone. Love could be in holiness, or love could be in such sinfulness, but love is love. Lilith, after countless struggles with her search for true love, she had found not only her greatest love of all, but also her true soul mate, not for one life, but for eternity. 
Author Brigitte Wynn Karey is a lover of words. The author expresses her thoughts not only to her audiences but also to herself. Her ability to use words to express her thoughts creatively in her own way was excellent. The imagination created in this book would let the audiences enjoy their mental imaginary visions as well as to open up the possibilities that they might have missed out." />
