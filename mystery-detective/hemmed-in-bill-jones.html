  <title>Hemmed In - Bill Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The tropical state of Porta Bella is Bling, where nubile wannabees kick start their career against the visual bliss of the coral-beached mecca of television and fashion shoots.
Gainesville City provides international tourists and commercial traffic a backdrop of thousands of kilometres of dangerous, inaccessible alligator infested wetlands. 
Hemmed In, a fast moving adult action thriller with loads of satirical humour, tells of glitz and glamour which involves a psychopath preying on beautiful models. Homicide Detectives Keeley Harrington and Barney Corvette are troubled keepers of the peace, following the trail of senseless murder and mayhem that is grotesquely exhibited around the city and wetlands. 
Keeley Harrington takes exception to the commissioning of an international profiler Victoria Ambrose, and resigns. Now unarmed, unwittingly placing her on the shopping list of a mass murderer.
Who is the killing machine, and how does he access a harvest of beautiful women ....strangely, keeping more of his collection alive than dead.so, where does he keep his butterflies?
A gripping and disturbing trip through the mind of a demented predator  a mix of  madness, unexpected adult  humour, confusion and evil. Youd be advised to turn on your alarm!
So If You Cant Breathe..You Might Be Hemmed In!" />
