  <title>Murder is an Art - Bill Crider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sally Good, head of the English and Fine Arts Division of the Hughes Community College in Texas, has her hands full.  On top of dealing with the numerous complaints from testy faculty members concerning the allocation of the department&#39;s budget, she must also conduct an inquiry into the recent misbehavior of the department&#39;s philandering art professor, Val Hurley, who stands accused of molesting a young female student.  And then there is the complaint lodged against the art department--and namely Val--for displaying what some people see as a satanic painting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Val is found bludgeoned to death in his office and the painting in question disappears, it isn&#39;t long before the department dissolves into a state of chaos and hysteria.  Sally begins to realize that she might be in over her head when the student in question is found murdered shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police aren&#39;t getting very far with their investigation: Their only tenuous suspect is the victim&#39;s husband, who has disappeared.  When Sally decides that her insider&#39;s knowledge of the department gives her a unique insight into the identity of the murderer, her decision could prove fatal.  With a little sleuthing, Sally, aided by attractive fellow professor Jack Neville, uncovers a lot more than she bargained for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
