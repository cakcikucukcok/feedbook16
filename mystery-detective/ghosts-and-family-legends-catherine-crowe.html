  <title>Ghosts and Family Legends - Catherine Crowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It happened that I spent the last winter in a large country mansion, in the north of England, where we had a succession of visitors, and all manner of amusements&amp;mdash;dancing, music, cards, billiards, and other games. Towards the end of December, 1857, however, the gaiety of the house was temporarily interrupted by a serious misfortune that occurred to one of the party, which, in the evening, occasioned us to assemble with grave faces round the drawing-room fire, where we fell to discussing the slight tenure by which we hold whatever blessings we enjoy, and the sad uncertainty of human life, as it affects us in its most mournful aspect&amp;mdash;the lives of those we love. From this theme, the conversation branched out into various speculations regarding the great mysteries of the here and hereafter; the reunion of friends, and the possible interests of them that have past away in the well-being of those they have left behind; till it fell, naturally, into the relation of certain experiences which almost everybody has had, more or less; and which were adduced to fortify the arguments of those who regard the future as less disjoined from the present than it is considered to be by Theologians generally." />
