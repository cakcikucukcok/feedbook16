  <title>The Cross Patch Caper: A Cozy Regency Mystery Romance - Susan Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Neither was Thomas Silas Price the most dashing member of the English Ton, nor was he one of the war heroes who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo the past June, but he had a passion and that was for the innocent and poor to have justice. Only life loved twists and turns and Silas ended up needing someone to champion his cause for justice. To make matters worse, he lost all his funds to save Lovridge Manor, his deceased dad&#39;s estate, to the harlot; rogue Galloping Jane, who was terrorizing the English Ton in the countryside for two years. How was he to marry the charming, belle of any ball, Margaret Hope Effinger, without funds or an estate, along with needing a handout to boot?" />
