  <title>Ultimate Fear - Rob Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Sons of Allah have cast the world into chaos. It starts with the poisoning of the American water supply. Nearly every state west of the Mississippi is without potable water; for the countless innocent victims who drank the tainted water, their early signs of sickness were quickly followed by painful deaths. But this is only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Three power plants are soon targeted, causing massive blackouts followed by looting and carnage that even the police cannot contain. In Europe, suicide bombers attack cities and kill thousands. Soon, a cyber attack on Washington, DC, cripples three highly classified divisions, and the economy tumbles into an abyss.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;All of these horrors, however, are mere distractions from the real game. In order to save the entire world, officials on Capitol Hill turn to an elite CIA operative team, a group trained to survive the worst conditions and fight the most odious foes. Will they seek out and stop the terrorists in time, or will the final agenda destroy humanity as we know it?&lt;/p&gt;" />
