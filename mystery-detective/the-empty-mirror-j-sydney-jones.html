  <title>The Empty Mirror - J. Sydney Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The summer of 1898 finds Austria terrorized by a killer who the press calls &quot;Vienna&#39;s Jack the Ripper.&quot; Four bodies have already been found, but when the painter Gustav Klimt&#39;s female model becomes the fifth victim, the police finger him as the culprit. The artist has already scandalized Viennese society with his erotically charged modern paintings. Who better to take the blame for the crimes that have plagued the city?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is, however, far from an open-and-shut case. Klimt&#39;s lawyer, Karl Werthen, has an ace up his sleeve. Dr. Hans Gross, the renowned father of criminology, has agreed to assist him in investigating the murders. Together, Gross and Werthen must not only clear Klimt&#39;s name but also follow the trail of a killer that will lead them in the most surprising of directions. By uncovering the cause of the crimes that have shaken the city, the two men may risk damaging Vienna more than the murders did themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by an acclaimed expert on Vienna and its history, &lt;i&gt;The Empty Mirror&lt;/i&gt; introduces a new series of stunning historical mysteries that reveals the culture and curiosities of this fascinating fin de siècle metropolis.&lt;/p&gt;" />
