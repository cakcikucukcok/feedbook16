  <title>House of Lords - Philip Rosenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Blaine is a good man, a wealthy and powerful Wall Street broker with impeccable social standing. But his wife&amp;#8212;who supports charitable foundations from their Park Avenue townhouse&amp;#8212;seems to have lost interest in their marriage, and his daughter, a beautiful debutante ready for Yale University in the fall, has turned sullen and rebellious. Having achieved everything he&#39;d ever dreamed of, Blaine now feels unsettled, stagnant, hungry for a new challenge&amp;#8212;a challenge that presents itself suddenly in the person of Chet Fiore, an ambitious entrepreneur rumored to be tied to organized crime. When Blaine rebukes Fiore&#39;s offer to participate in an illegal business proposition, he discovers that the mafia lieutenant has laid an elaborate trap to ensure Blaine&#39;s cooperation: the abduction of his beloved daughter. To ensure her safe return, Blaine is forced now to become a partner in a money laundering scheme of immense proportions. But once the transaction is completed, Blaine is a changed man, unexpectedly empowered by Fiore&#39;s demands, a man ready to shed his staid past for the urgency and risk of a life of crime; and so they form an alliance that forever changes the lives of both men, leading to the demise of one and the corruption of the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;House of Lords&lt;/em&gt; is a riveting investigation of power and corruption&amp;#8212;part human drama, part thriller&amp;#8212;that has the potential both to be a critically acclaimed portrait of our age.&lt;/p&gt;" />
