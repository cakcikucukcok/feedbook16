  <title>Avery Black Mystery: Cause to Kill (#1), Cause to Run (#2), and Cause to Hide (#3) - Blake Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A dynamic story line that grips from the first chapter and doesn&#39;t let go.&quot; &lt;p&gt;--Midwest Book Review, Diane Donovan (regarding Once Gone) &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From #1 bestselling mystery author Blake Pierce comes a new masterpiece of psychological suspense. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bundle of books #1 (CAUSE TO KILL), #2 (CAUSE TO RUN) and #3 (CAUSE TO HIDE) in Blake Pierce&#39;s Avery Black Mystery series! This bundle offers books one, two, and three in one convenient file, with over 200,000 words of reading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CAUSE TO KILL, Homicide Detective Avery Black has been through hell. Once a top criminal defense attorney, she fell from grace when she managed to get a brilliant Harvard professor off-only to watch him kill again. She lost her husband and her daughter, and her life fell apart around her. Trying to redeem herself, Avery has turned to the other side of the law. Working her way up the ranks, she has reached Homicide Detective, to the scorn of her fellow officers, who still remember what she did, and who will always hate her. Yet even they cannot deny Avery&#39;s brilliant mind, and when a disturbing serial killer strikes fear into the heart of Boston, killing girls from elite colleges, it is Avery that they turn to. It is Avery&#39;s chance to prove herself, to finally find the redemption she craves. And yet, as she is soon to find out, Avery has come up against a killer as brilliant and daring as she.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CAUSE TO RUN, a new serial killer is stalking Boston, killing his victims in bizarre ways, taunting the police with mysterious puzzles that reference the stars. As the stakes are upped and the pressure is on, the Boston Police Department is forced to call in its most brilliant-and most controversial-homicide detective: Avery Black. Avery, still reeling from her last case, finds herself up against a rival precinct and a brilliant, cunning killer who is always one step ahead of her. She is forced to enter his dark, twisted mind as he lays clues for his next killing, and forced to look into places in her own mind she would rather not go. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CAUSE TO HIDE, bodies are being found in the outskirts of Boston, their corpses burned beyond recognition, as the police realize a new serial killer is roaming the streets. As the media converges and the pressure is upped, the Boston Police Department must turn to its most brilliant-and controversial-homicide detective: Avery Black. Avery, still trying to pick up the pieces of her own life-her budding relationship with Ramirez, her reconciliation with Rose-suddenly finds herself thrown into the most challenging case of her career.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark psychological thrillers with heart-pounding suspense, the AVERY BLACK MYSTERY series is a riveting new series-with a beloved new character-that will leave you turning pages late into the night. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book #4 in the Avery Black series will be available soon." />
