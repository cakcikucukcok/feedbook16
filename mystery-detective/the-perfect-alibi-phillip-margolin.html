  <title>The Perfect Alibi - Phillip Margolin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &quot;master of heart-pounding suspense&quot;--&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; bestseller Phillip Margolin--returns with a new legal thriller starring Robin Lockwood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; A young woman accuses a prominent local college athlete of rape. Convicted with the help of undisputable DNA evidence, the athlete swears his innocence and threatens both his lawyer and his accuser as he&#39;s sent to prison. Not long after, there&#39;s another rape and the DNA test shows that the same person committed both rapes--which is seemingly impossible since the man convicted of the first rape was in prison at the time of the second one. Now, the convicted athlete, joined by a new lawyer, is granted a new trial and bail. Shortly thereafter, his original lawyer disappears and his law partner is murdered.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robin Lockwood is a young lawyer with a prestigious small law firm and a former MMA fighter who helped pay for Yale Law School with her bouts. She is representing the victim of the first rape for her civil lawsuit against her rapist, who is now convinced the rapist is stalking her and trying to intimidate her. At the same time, another client is up on a murder charge--one that should be dismissed as self-defense--but the D.A. trying the case is determined to bring it to trial. Now she has to mastermind two impossible cases, trying to find the hidden truth that links the two of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Phillip Margolin, the master of the legal thriller, returns in one of his twistiest, most compelling crime novels yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
