      <meta name="description" content="Ke&amp;rsquo;yoko   and Ka&amp;rsquo;yah are identical twins with two totally different  personalities. As   young girls they formed a bond that could not be  broken. It isn&amp;rsquo;t until they   become grown women that their loyalty is  tested by secrets, deception, and   lies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up with a  strict and controlling father and a weak and sniveling   mother,  Ke&amp;rsquo;yoko&amp;rsquo;s only goal is to get as far away from them as possible, even    if it means leaving Ka&amp;rsquo;yah behind. Being rescued by Ja&amp;rsquo;Rel is like a  dream   come true. Ke&amp;rsquo;yoko thinks her world with Ja&amp;rsquo;Rel is perfect until  she starts   unraveling the truth behind it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To secure her  future, Ke&amp;rsquo;yoko decides to get into the dope game with her   best friend  Nadia, who is the breath of fresh air Ke&amp;rsquo;yoko needs to escape the    harsh reality of the fake life she&amp;rsquo;s been living.&amp;#160; Ke&amp;rsquo;yoko puts together  a crew, all while   trying to keep her squeaky clean image. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ka&amp;rsquo;yah,  the more laid back of the twins, always has her sister&amp;rsquo;s back, even    if it means putting herself and her son last.&amp;#160;   Having her hands full  raising her young son on her own, she always   seems to be in Ke&amp;rsquo;yoko&amp;rsquo;s  shadow. Just once she wants to come out ahead of her   sister, to have  something or someone for herself. How far is she willing to   go to have  that? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a chain of shocking events, Ke&amp;rsquo;yoko finds out the hard way that everyone   is suspect.&lt;br&gt;Family  and friends mean nothing, and loyalty is just a word.   However,  Ke&amp;rsquo;yoko refuses to let &amp;lsquo;em see her sweat. She is determined to put   on  her game face and keep it moving, but that definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean  things   will be business as usual." />
