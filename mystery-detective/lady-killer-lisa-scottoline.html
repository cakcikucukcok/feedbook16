  <title>Lady Killer - Lisa Scottoline</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mary DiNunzio has become a big-time business-getter at Rosato &amp;#38; Associates. But the last person she expects to walk into her office one morning&amp;#8212;in mile-high stilettos&amp;#8212;is super-sexy Trish Gambone, her high-school rival. Back when Mary was becoming the straight-A president of the Latin Club and Most Likely to Achieve Sainthood, Trish was the head Mean Girl, who flunked religion and excelled at smoking in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, however, Trish needs help. She is terrified of her live-in boyfriend, an abusive, gun-toting drug dealer for the South Philly mob. Mary remembers the guy from high school, too. She had a major crush on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Trish vanishes, a dead body turns up in an alley, and Mary is plunged into a nightmare that threatens her job, her family, and even her life. She goes on a one-woman crusade to unmask the killer, and on the way finds new love in a very unexpected place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
