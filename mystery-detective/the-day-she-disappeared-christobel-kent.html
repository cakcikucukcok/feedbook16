      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Christobel Kent--whose psychological thrillers have been called &quot;terrifyingly good,&quot; &quot;perfectly paced,&quot; &quot;addictive,&quot; &quot;tense, dense, extremely well-plotted and beautifully written&quot;--a new nerve-racking novel about a disappeared barmaid and the friend who will do anything to find her.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Beth disappears, everyone says she&#39;s run off with another man. She&#39;s just a fly-by-night party girl who can&#39;t be trusted. But Natalie, her best friend, doesn&#39;t believe it, not at all. She&#39;s sure something more sinister is going on. So sure that proving it just might kill her . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Victor, one of Beth&#39;s and Nat&#39;s favorite bar patrons, has fallen and ended up in the hospital. When he hears that Beth is gone, he doesn&#39;t buy it either. And slowly, a hazy memory comes back to him. Something menacing . . . something important . . . something just out of his grasp . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Nat tries to piece together the events--and people--in Beth&#39;s life, it becomes more difficult to discern who can and can&#39;t be trusted. The little town in the English countryside takes on an ominous air, with a threat behind every corner, outside every window. And someone is always watching . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent&#39;s most recent novel, &lt;i&gt;The Loving Husband&lt;/i&gt;, was an international bestseller, and it is in no way hyperbole to declare &lt;i&gt;The Day She Disappeared&lt;/i&gt; her very best. It is as brutally unsettling as &lt;i&gt;The Loving Husband&lt;/i&gt;, but even more intricate and surprising; as claustrophobic and atmospheric as &lt;i&gt;The Crooked House&lt;/i&gt;, but even more heartbreaking in its truths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent has been compared to such masters as Daphne du Maurier and P. D. James. With &lt;i&gt;The Day She Disappeared&lt;/i&gt;, a new crop of writers will be compared to Christobel Kent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
