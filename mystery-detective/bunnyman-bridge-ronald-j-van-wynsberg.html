  <title>Bunnyman Bridge - Ronald J Van Wynsberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It took Joan Fortune, a former New York Detective, five years to come to terms with the murder of her husband, John, and their unborn child. Now, as the Sheriff of Milford, Virginia, a sleepy tourist town, she is confronted with an evil unlike anything she has ever seen. When four kids are all found murdered by hanging under an abandoned mining bridge, it is up to Joan, her daughter, Caitlin, and a stranger, to save the life of Kimberly Clark, the fifth child taken. Caitlin is a clairvoyant, her gift of sight is vital to helping Joan save Kimberlys life.  The stranger believes that there is an eerie resemblance to murders that took place thirty-two years before.  Joan must rely on her own instincts and a voice in her head to determine who she can trust, and whom she cannot." />
