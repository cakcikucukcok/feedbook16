  <title>The Forces of Evil - Marlene Eunice Amero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This horror story would capture any age of understanding to a desire to read and continue to read. This mansion that was known to be haunted for many years was tested by some children who dreaded to prove it was true. But being told by their parents to stay away from the place they went anyway because they were forced by an evil force to go. JB the main character had a vision one night drawing his attention to the old mansion. He could never feel comfortable or able to sleep until he went there. He was not going alone, so he took some friends with him. What surprises they encountered each time they went there would surprise you. Always thinking they would have no more worries or problems if they did what she wanted them to do, was bury her. They thought that was it until they looked back at the old mansion and noticed her up in the attic laughing at them.
So much is yet to come in this book it is hard to put it down. Find out all the evil tricks the witch did to keep them coming. JB, David and the rest of his friends dreaded to go back each time the witch called for them. They wanted to tell their parents but they were warned she would kill them if they didnt keep her a secret.
A good book to want to continue to read. More evil forces are yet to come. Will the children later help prove the mansion is really haunted? Watch for my second book The Force of Evil, part two." />
