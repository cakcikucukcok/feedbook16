  <title>Apparitions - Robert N. Chan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jed Caplan, a lawyer who has written a stack of unpublished novels, is unnerved when he encounters one of his fictional characters in the flesh. Then his most fascinating creation, a brilliant and seductive thrill-killer, takes a romantic interest in him. Intoxicated by their kinky sex, Jed stops caring whether she is a figment of his imagination or a living psychopath. Then she vanishes along with all evidence that she ever existed. Have the pressures of divorce, fatherhood, and his cutthroat law practice driven Jed crazy? Or is he the target of a vengeful conspiracy? He runs from one false lead to another until he discovers the horrifying truth, and realizes he must bend it to his own advantage. By slaying his own demons, Jed reveals the dark underside of the glittering world of the New York legal elite and comes to understand true love.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Apparitions&lt;/I&gt; may be the funniest thriller of the millennium, or it might merely be the wisest, sexiest and most provocative book of the century. The critics are split. You decide." />
