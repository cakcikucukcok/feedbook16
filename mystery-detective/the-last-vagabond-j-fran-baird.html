  <title>The Last Vagabond - J. Fran Baird</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;1934Emil Langerzweig&#39;s public censure of Nazi collaboration forced him to flee his homeland with a young son and a dream. In Austria, his aristocratic family raised Lipizzaner horses for the Spanish Court. In America, he&#39;d change his name to Longbranch, modify the age-old tradition, raise Thoroughbreds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thad Longbranch, third-generation cowboy at the reins of the &quot;Bar L,&quot; is living his grandfather&#39;s dream, confident his children will insure continuity of the dynasty. Buffered by fifteen-thousand acres in the foothills of the Rockies, his wife Sam seems content homeschooling, writing children&#39;s books. Satisfying, predictable, life is gooduntil the letters arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearing the Colorado State Seal, the first missive poses a request that thrusts Sam into the political arena, fosters a relationship with a charming would-be Governor, jeopardizes a twenty-year marriage. Postmarked Mexico, the second letter reveals a longheld secret, a secret that threatens succession of the Longbranch family, and propels a crazed Mexican drug lord across the border to Colorado in search of an orphaned boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprinkled with humorempathetic characters and villains you&#39;ll love to hate, bring to life this fast-paced tale of passion, murder, remorse and acceptance of a child who may lay claim to a fortunethe last vagabond.&lt;/p&gt;" />
