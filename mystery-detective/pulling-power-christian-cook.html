  <title>Pulling Power - Christian Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="EARTHQUAKE HOSPITAL SUICIDE SHOCK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of patients rescued from the earthquake in California were discovered carrying out a bizarre suicide pact yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By listening in on staff discussions the four had discovered that all of them needed a heart transplant in order to survive, but only one heart was available. Not wanting to leave the decision in the hands of others they began a twisted game of chance, in order to decide who received the heart. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt; It was a temporary ward, explained Dr. Bowndes. There was a mass of wires on the floor that powered the radios, lamps, ECGs and ventilators by their beds. They went round, in turn, pulling out one plug at a time. They had no idea what was plugged in where  it was Russian Roulette with power plugs. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The nurse who discovered the aftermath described it as like something out of a horror movie. &lt;/p&gt;
