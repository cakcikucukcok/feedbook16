  <title>The Serfanatin Trial - Tom Dalton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In an industry where it costs a billion dollars to bring a new pharmaceutical drug to market the
pressure to cut corners and manipulate information is always present. Adding to this is the inherent
human weakness of greed when large amounts of money are at stake. Tommy Lee Jessup has
over the years developed a successful Phase I drug testing program and he now sees the opportunity
to benefi t fi nancially when he is given the chance to conduct a clinical trial for a new anti-psychotic
drug, Serfanatin.
As early trial results begin to go awry, Jessup takes action to cover up the negative testing results.
Each such move leads to increasingly deadly results. As the pressure mounts, Jessup turns to his
confi dant and uncontrollable fi xer, Caleb Guernsey, for help not realizing that the body count
will increase even faster.
New York State Police Lieutenant, Connor Lachlan tries to make sense of what appears to be
a series of unconnected deaths in his rural upstate region. As he examines the events and the
connections begin to appear, Lachlan becomes entwined not only as an investigator but also a
potential victim.
The rolling hills of central New York State amidst a frigid winter, presents this backdrop for a
deadly battle between two adversaries that will stop at nothing to accomplish their goals." />
