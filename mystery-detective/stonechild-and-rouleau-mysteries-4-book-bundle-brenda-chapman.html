      <meta name="description" content="When damaged, brilliant detective Kala Stonechild and workaholic staff sergeant Jacques Rouleau get paired up, pieces start falling into place. The series has been called “deeply atmospheric and tightly plotted” and praised for its grit. Now, the first four mysteries are available together in an ebook-exclusive bundle at a special price.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Includes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cold Mourning – Book #1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A week before Christmas, wealthy businessman Tom Underwood disappears into thin air, with more than enough people wanting him dead. Kala Stonechild is a new member of the specialized Ottawa Police unit tasked with bringing him home for the holidays, but a killer has other plans. Who can you trust when love turns to hate and murder stalks a family?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Butterfly Kills – Book #2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Rouleau is in a new job in a new city. He’s in a fight against time to keep his dysfunctional team together long enough to get to sort out the innocent from the evil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tumbled Graves – Book #3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
When Adele Delaney and her daughter go missing, Kala Stonechild and Paul Gundersund investigate. Adele’s body soon turns up — dead, with no sign of her daughter. Struggling to to keep the case on track and her own life under control, Stonechild learns the dead woman had ties to a Montreal biker gang and heads to Quebec to find the missing piece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shallow End – Book #4, NEW!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Convicted child molester Jane Thompson has made parole, but one month later the body of the student she was found guilty of abusing is found on the shores of Lake Ontario. Sergeant Rouleau assigns Officers Stonechild and Gundersund to head up the murder investigation, but things quickly get ugly, and not just with the case." />
