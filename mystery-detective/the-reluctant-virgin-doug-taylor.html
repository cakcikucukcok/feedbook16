  <title>The Reluctant Virgin - Doug Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In every decade, deeds are committed in dark places that are unknown to those who tread lifes well-lit paths. Even so, as a new era dawns in Toronto of the 1950s, no one suspects that a serial killer is about to unleash a fury on the quiet residential avenues and in the forested river valleys. 
On Labour Day weekend in 1951, just as thirteen-year-old Tom Hudson is ready to begin high school, a sadistic killer strikes. A female member of the schools staff is brutally murdered in the secluded darkness of the Humber Valley, and the police suspect another teacher has committed the crime. After detectives Gerry Thomson and Jim Peersen are assigned to the case, another innocent victim is murdered. As the investigation heats up, Tom and his friends attempt to go about their normal livesdeveloping as teenagers dobut it is not long before they become unwittingly caught up with the mystery behind the brutal killings. 
As the killers rage intensifies, everyone fears another murder lies in the shadows. Now it is up to two detectives and a group of curious teenagers to find a psychopath hell-bent on seeking revengebefore further violence occurs." />
