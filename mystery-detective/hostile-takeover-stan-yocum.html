  <title>Hostile Takeover - Stan Yocum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if you came up with an incredibly brilliant idea? And then you developed your idea into a one-of-kind product and founded a very successful company around it. But then a high-powered individual comes along and says he wants to buy your company  and you had better sell, or else!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet Jason Chappell, a young engineer who has designed a revolutionary electric car that could save America from financial chaos caused from the inflation of crude oil prices beyond levels ever experienced. However, Ethan Gantry, the infamous King of Takeovers and a billionaire many times over, wants Jasons company, in addition to owning the next President of the United States, all in an attempt to inflate his substantial wealth. And Gantry is willing to do whatever it takes to attain both a president and Jasons company.  The presidential hopeful is more than willing to go along with Gantrys strategies to attain the oval office. Jason, on the other hand, wants nothing to do with Gantry and fights the mega mogul to save his company - and his life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
