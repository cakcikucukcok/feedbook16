  <title>The Good Thief&#39;s Guide to Paris - Chris Ewan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The moment I&#39;d scanned the outside of the building, I turned to Bruno and said, &quot;First impressions, it looks straightforward.&quot; Looking back, I can&#39;t help but wonder what I was thinking. I mean, put that line at the opening of a crime novel and it&#39;s practically a guarantee that everything is about to get complicated.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Charlie Howard--globe-trotting mystery writer, professional thief, and poor decision maker--is in Paris. Flush with the success of his latest book reading, not to mention a few too many glasses of wine, Charlie agrees to show a complete novice how to break into an apartment in the Marais. Fast-forward twenty-four hours and Charlie&#39;s hired to steal an ordinary-looking oil painting--from the exact same address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mere coincidence? Charlie figures there&#39;s no harm in finding out--until a dead body turns up in his living room and he finds himself evading the law while becoming caught up in a quite outrageous heist. And that&#39;s before Charlie&#39;s literary agent, Victoria (who&#39;s naive enough to assume that he looks like his author photo), finally decides they should meet face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever said a life of suspense was easy, but in Chris Ewan&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Good Thief&#39;s Guide to Paris, &lt;/i&gt;Charlie, the most disarmingly charming burglar since Cary Grant, soon finds things are getting way out of control.&lt;/p&gt;" />
