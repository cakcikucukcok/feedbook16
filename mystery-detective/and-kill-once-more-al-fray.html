  <title>And Kill Once More - Al Fray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In one jump, Marty Bowman made it from lifeguard to bodyguard -- and what a body! Her name was Kate. She hired him as her protector and/or playmate. She took him to a luxurious desert hideaway. All of which was fine with Marty -- until his lucky silver dollar turned up in the fingers of a corpse. One of the guests was out to frame him, maybe murder him!&lt;P&gt;
Marty figured he and his gun could make out even against guys as dangerous as Dr. Cronk. But what about women like Sandra, who’d swim only after dark? And glamorous Elsa, so interested in his muscles? Unless Marty could flush the killer among them, and quick, the weekend with Kate would wind up with him in a pine box -- or the gas chamber!" />
