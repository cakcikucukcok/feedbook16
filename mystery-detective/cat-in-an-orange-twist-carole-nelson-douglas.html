  <title>Cat in an Orange Twist - Carole Nelson Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Temple Barr is a sharp and sassy public relations ace in Las Vegas whose life is finally taking a turn for the better. Hard-nosed homicide lieutenant Carmen Molina is too busy chasing after her own ex-lover, rogue L.A. cop Rafi Nadir, to pursue Temple&#39;s boyfriend, sexy magician Max Kinsella, and nobody Temple knows has been murdered... at least, not in the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temple takes this downtime as a signal she should buy a new pair of Jimmy Choo spike heels, and accept the job of planning a glitzy week of opening events for a trendy new furniture showroom.  Dealing with temperamental décor mavens is no problem for a woman who&#39;s saved leopards from big game hunters, tracked killers through strip clubs, calmed the cantankerous owners of Las Vegas&#39;s most glamorous hotel, and seen the ghost of Elvis-until the life of feng shui expert and media-crowned domestic dominatrix Amelia Wong is threatened.  Suddenly Temple is neck deep in trouble... and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Temple has one more problem-one she doesn&#39;t even know about: her roommate Louie, and his maybe-daughter Louise, have decided to make sure that Temple&#39;s search for a killer furniture arrangement doesn&#39;t mean curtains for her.  Midnight Inc. Investigations, their PI firm, is on the case.  The catch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louie is Temple&#39;s cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
