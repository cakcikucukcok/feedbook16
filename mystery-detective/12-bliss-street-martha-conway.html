  <title>12 Bliss Street - Martha Conway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Short-story writer Conway&#39;s jump to novel length is as lean and sexy as her cardio-kickboxing heroine.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicola is having a really bad day. She&#39;s tired of her job, her boss, and even her San Francisco apartment, which she&#39;s just heard she&#39;s being evicted from anyway. Her life&#39;s only excitement is fueled by fantasy - about the expensive lingerie she wears under her business suits, about a man she sees at lunch every day, a darkly handsome man she calls Chorizo, after the kind of pizza he orders. She&#39;s flat-out tired of her life, and nothing brings it home more than running into her annoying but harmless ex-husband, Scooter, on the way to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if ever anyone learns a lesson in &quot;be careful what you wish for,&quot; it&#39;s Nicola, because suddenly her life seems to be full of excitement. First she gets kidnapped after kickboxing class by two inept teenagers who, it turns out, aren&#39;t your garden-variety ransom kidnappers at all. But before she can resolve this situation, her innocent flirtation with Chorizo turns sinister. Suddenly Nicola&#39;s problem is no longer how to survive her boredom but how to survive, period.  All in all, Martha Conway&#39;s debut is a deliciously hip, sexy, and suspenseful crime novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
