  <title>Theo&#39;s Secret - John Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theo is ugly.
The girls whispered voice returned in the darkness, and sang the chant, Theo is ugly. Theo is ugly. 
Theo Martins sister waited for his reaction from the backseat of the family car. Eight-year-old Theo turned away. He looked at his faint reflection in the car window.
Am I ugly? he wondered.
Suddenly, there was a truck. There was a scream, an impact, bending metal, shattered glass, a tree, and blood. 
Moments after the crash, Theo found himself caught between two worlds. It was clear to him he was not heaven-bound with his family, but instead, returning as the sole survivor. 
However, when he returned, he brought a secret back with him. 
And like a hand in a poker game he would sometimes play, it was best for him to keep his secret from others, especially when he witnessed their cruelty and their capacity for destruction. But Theo of all people should have known not to be fooled by appearances. Everyone has secrets.
There was even a secret in the mud of a local pond that if discovered, would unravel many other surprises.
So, when a drought ravages the landscape of the northeast town of Copper Valley, it means the best chance for that secret to be revealed.
Receding water alone will not be enough. It will remain at the bottom of a murky pond unless Theo Martin, Copper Valleys angriest recluse, forgives old sins.
A soaking rain is coming from the west. Theo cant wait forever." />
