  <title>Milo March #3 - Kendell Foster Crossen, M.E. Chaber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Samson Hercules Carter is a little man with a big name who has fallen obsessively in love with a diamond. The Tavernier Blue is only a little smaller than a golf ball and worth a fortune. To insurance investigator Milo March, the hunk of carbon doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem as attractive as the equivalent in cash, but he can see why the little man might want to put it in his pocket and take a walk. But the problem is, Carter has also shot a man to death in the process.&lt;br /&gt;
The insurance company sends Milo to track down the murderer and recover the stolen diamond&amp;mdash;a task made all the more urgent because he&amp;rsquo;s got competition. Some of the world&amp;rsquo;s top jewel thieves would also like to get their hands on the diamond, from sinister professionals to a beautiful seductress. In one of Milo&amp;rsquo;s wildest adventures ever,&amp;nbsp;the chase takes him from New York to Lisbon and Madrid, where the thief, a mild-mannered accountant, has transformed himself into a new identity as a cultured gentleman, an alternate personality that he has secretly developed for years. Getting the thief back to America for prosecution is challenge enough&amp;mdash;but where the hell did the little man hide the diamond?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Man Inside&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;was made into an English film of the same name in 1958, directed by John Gilling and starring Jack Palance and Anita Eckberg." />
