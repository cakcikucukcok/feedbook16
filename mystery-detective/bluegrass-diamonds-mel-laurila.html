  <title>Bluegrass Diamonds - Mel Laurila</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is a SECRET to the success of the Blue Diamond horse farm:  Some people will do just about anything to find out what it is.  &quot;Diamond Jim&quot; Taylor is living the dream. He is a successful entrepreneur who has taken an idea from concept to commercialization and licensed his x-ray borehole analyzer to an instrumentation company that pays him substantial royalties to sell it all over the world. On his Blue Diamond farm in Lexington, Kentucky stands his prize Kentucky Derby winning stallion, Diamond in the Rough, earning him a few million more each year in stud fees.   He has been recently awarded a patent on a related, proprietary process to colorize diamonds throughout their entire structure so that they are virtually indistinguishable from the rare, natural colored stones. There are several people interested in this technology, including a beautiful, mining heiress who owns her own diamond and gold mines. But none more than Jim&#39;s ex-partner who believes he&#39;s owed a piece of the action.  When Diamond in the Rough is stolen, Jim goes hunting to find out who is behind the theft. From the Kentucky Bluegrass to New York&#39;s Diamond District to the tundra of Canada&#39;s Northern Territories to Australia&#39;s Melbourne Cup, he finds himself in a whirlwind search for those who wish to destroy him. What Jim ultimately discovers is...life changing." />
