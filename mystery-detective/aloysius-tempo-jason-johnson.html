  <title>Aloysius Tempo - Jason Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Irish-born Aloysius is a freelance killer for hire. Advertising his services - the &#39;hard solve&#39; - on the Dark Web, he arranges fatal accidents, convenient deaths. &#39;My job is the only job in the world where people you should have killed will throw it back in your face.&#39; Living off-grid, an old contact from home offers him work. Aloysius doesn&#39;t take the bait and gets cornered by Imelda, the steely head of a shadowy unit close to the Irish government. &#39;You&#39;re dressed, Aloysius, like someone who might arrive to service a horse and cart . . . You look like you styled your hair in a public toilet and through a fucking hat.&#39; She lures him in and sets him up to kill four of the nation&#39;s most hated citizens. It&#39;s all part of an extraordinary, ruthless PR operation, as the state prepares to mark its centenary. &#39;This is a young little nation and, like any youth, it needs a little bit of guidance, a bit of a push onto the next level, to a place where it can know itself better.&#39; As he gets to work, Aloysius is plunged into a web of high tech international espionage. It quickly becomes clear that powerful forces are watching his every move - and want him permanently out of the way. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Jason Johnson&#39;s four novels focus on people facing extreme situations over short periods of time. Death, humour, lust and alcohol have so far featured prominently. Woundlicker (2005), a serial killer&#39;s confession, is set in Northern Ireland. Alina (2006), the hunt for a vanished sex worker, is set in Romania. Sinker (2014), where drinking alcohol is a professional sport, is set in Majorca. Jason is from Enniskillen and lives in Belfast." />
