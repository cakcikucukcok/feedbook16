  <title>Long Teeth - Marvin H. Albert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pete Sawyer is a private eye of a different kind. The son of a World War II American pilot and a brave French resistance fighter, he grew up on both sides of the Atlantic -- though he prefers his sun-dappled villa on the Riviera to most other places. He takes pleasure in a fine wine...and a good gun. His French name is Pierre-Ange, and it suits him. In English, it means Stone Angel.&lt;P&gt;When Arlette Alfani, a lawyer as competent as she is beautiful, asks Pete to help her client whose wife has been kidnapped, Pete agrees -- only to find that the man in question is none other than Karl Malo, the inconceivably wealthy patriarch of the Malo Transport family. Completely in love for the first time in his life, Malo is inconsolable over the kidnapping of his third wife, Jacqueline. But no sooner has Pete done all he can to get Jacqueline back than Malo has another problem. Someone very close to him has betrayed him. Is it his brilliant, rebellious son, Alexandre? His one-wild daughter, Claudette? His imeccably tailored son-in-law, Jean-Noel? Pete Sawyer must keep his eyes open -- and his gun at hand -- to solve this family affair." />
