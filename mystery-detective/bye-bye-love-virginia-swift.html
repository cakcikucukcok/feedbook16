  <title>Bye, Bye, Love - Virginia Swift</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the third book in Virginia Swift&#39;s acclaimed mystery series, Sally Alder, hailed by USA Today as &quot;Wyoming&#39;s version of TV&#39;s Jessica Fletcher or Agatha Christie&#39;s Miss Marple,&quot; is back with her colorful cohorts to investigate a bizarre murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, it&#39;s embarrassing for a woman of her professional stature and self-image still to have a crush on singer Thomas &quot;Stone&quot; Jackson, a guy whose nickname derives from his legendary propensity for addictive substances. But when Jackson appears one day and asks college professor and sometime sleuth Sally Alder for a little help, she can&#39;t say no. Jackson is worried about his ex-wife, folksinger Nina Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out his concern is justified when Nina is found shot to death in the snow-covered forest behind her house. While the sheriff&#39;s office believes Nina&#39;s death is most likely a hunting accident, Sally is unconvinced. It&#39;s up to her to get to the truth, as she uncovers a plot fueled by a twisted mixture of altruism and greed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praised by critics for her &quot;lively characters and surprising plot twists&quot; (&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;), and &quot;good local color&quot; (&lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;), Virginia Swift has once again created a fast-paced, clever tale of murder and mayhem, sure to keep readers on the edge of their seats.&lt;/p&gt;" />
