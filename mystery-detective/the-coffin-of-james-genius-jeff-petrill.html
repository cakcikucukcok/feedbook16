  <title>The Coffin of James Genius - Jeff Petrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Genius is a traveler hiding a secret. While trying to fit into a community that thrives off death, James begins building a new life that quickly turns into a personal hell in futuristic America.&lt;p&gt;
A new Civil War brews in America while James simultaneously fights his own internal demons and hallucinations as he attempts to locate the survivors of his hidden family. While the government promises to protect and separate citizens from one another, obsessive political control and suspicious behavior begins to confuse and upset the public. As a result, survival groups start preparing for the collapse of the government while a news organization, The Zoo Trials, tries to explain and solve the country&#39;s seemingly inevitable demise. James holds the key to a major change, but in a futile attempt to protect himself, he pretends he doesn&#39;t recall his past. Meanwhile, others encourage James to reveal his true self, but he waits for the right moment to fuel his transformation.&lt;p&gt;
Only time will tell if James finds the real life he&#39;s been desperately seeking and if the citizens of this revolutionary community will pull together and plant the seeds of positive change." />
