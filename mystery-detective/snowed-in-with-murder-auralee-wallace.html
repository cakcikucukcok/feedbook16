  <title>Snowed In with Murder - Auralee Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There&#39;s no retreat and no surrender when Erica Bloom finds herself stuck in a snow storm with a stone-cold killer. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica has returned to Otter Lake, New Hampshire, to rekindle her romance with Sheriff Grady Forrester at her mom&#39;s island retreat, currently closed for the off season. Just ahead of a rapidly advancing storm front, Erica arrives to discover Mom has rented the lodge to a reality TV show. They&#39;re filming the wealthy but awful Boatright brood, who&#39;ve been summoned here by their patriarch because--so he says--one of them wants to kill him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SNOWED IN WITH MURDER&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;br&gt;  Great television, terrible timing. Not only are Erica&#39;s romantic hopes snuffed out like a candle flame, the nasty Nor&#39;easter just became a superstorm...and no one is getting off the island &#39;til it blows over. When the power fails, it&#39;s lights out for the patriarch. Now, marooned with a murdered millionaire and his feuding family, it&#39;s up to Erica to take the killer by storm and get back to the business of reuniting with Grady--until death do they part!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;b&gt;&quot;Time spent with the folks in Otter Lake is well worthwhile, with writing that is witty, contemporary, and winning.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t miss &lt;i&gt;Snowed In with Murder&lt;/i&gt;, part of the hilarious Otter Lake series by Auralee Wallace!&lt;/p&gt;" />
