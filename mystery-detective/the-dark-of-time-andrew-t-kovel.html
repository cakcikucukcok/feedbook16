  <title>The Dark of Time - Andrew T. Kovel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Newly graduated political science major from Boston University, Dennis Paxton finds himself thrown into a chaotic swirl of personal crisis and political intrigue immediately upon graduating. Before having an opportunity to enjoy success and chart his own course for the future, he has to deal with the harrowing reality of the loss of his twelve-year-old brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In returning to his home in South Hooksett, New Hampshire, in order to attend his brothers funeral, he immediately gets hooked into a job offer that is provided to him by his meddling Uncle Dan. Not just any offer, it is a position of high importance working for the Republican candidate for the presidency of the United States. Encouraged to accept by his best friend and fellow graduate from Boston University, Thereasa Berman, and other family members, Dennis reluctantly agrees to the position, even though he is a fervent Democrat. In accepting the job, he is whisked away to New York City to meet the charismatic senator from Massachusetts who is to be his new boss, James Meirden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his reluctance to accept this role, Dennis Paxton never could have imagined where it would take him. He quickly finds that he is so discouraged by the state of American politics that he no longer desires to be a politician. Beyond that, in acting as a financial liaison between the senator and his largest contributor to the candidates campaign for presidencythe largest pharmaceutical company in the world, Wycell PharmaceuticalsDennis discovers an unbelievable conspiracy thats been in operation by the United States government over the last forty years, a sinister mind-control program that no one has any clue about. In investigating the conspiracy, Dennis goes from a person with political aspirations to a whistle-blower who is required to place not only his future career at stake but his very life. In order to bring the information to light, he must rely on a combination of new acquaintances and associates to his closest friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
