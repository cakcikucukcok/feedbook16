  <title>Closer Still - Jo Bannister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bannister is one of the undersung treasures of the mystery genre.&quot; ---&lt;i&gt;Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Tribune&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she has been trying to put her work, running a one-woman detective agency, on hold while she cares for her new baby, Jonathan, Brodie soon learns that taking time off is not as easy as it sounds. Not only does Jonathan have a rare disease that may leave him blind, his father, Detective Superintendent Jack Deacon, is going after the nastiest crook in town, Joe Loomis, who quickly retaliates by threatening Brodie and little Jonathan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Loomis bleeds to death while trying to utter a name that begins with the letter &quot;D,&quot; Brodie isn&#39;t quite sure it is just a coincidence and worries Deacon may have become entangled in yet another crime. But Loomis had plenty of enemies and Deacon isn&#39;t the only one who had reason to do him harm. When Dev Stretton, another suspect, turns out to be linked to Brodie&#39;s best friend, Daniel Hood, she has no choice but to take up the search for the killer. As events spiral out of control and entanglements weave together in complex patterns, Brodie must learn to keep her friends close, and her enemies closer still.&lt;/p&gt;" />
