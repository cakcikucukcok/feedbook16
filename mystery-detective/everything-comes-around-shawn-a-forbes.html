  <title>Everything Comes Around - Shawn A. Forbes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Geoff Parks has it all:  good looks, money beyond belief and a stellar career as a professional basketball player.  He is a one-man-dynasty in the making and everyone wants a piece of him.  He is the toast of Madison Avenue and the man everyone wants to know until a hungry and bitter tabloid reporter sets her sights on him and breaks a story that threatens to bring his world crashing down in disgrace.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Caroline Hicks has spent her whole life running away  from physical, sexual and emotional abuse, from love and from herself.  She is equal parts victim and vixen.  Her thirst for the big time catapults her into the orbit of the beloved and phenomenally-talented basketball superstar Geoff Parks.  Almost overnight, she goes from an unknown wanna-be journalist to the toast the Atlanta news world, after she breaks a story that turns Geoff Parks&#39; world upside down.  But in the process, she forgets to deal with the skeletons in her own closet  the walls of which are torn down by a single telephone call.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jason Dash is the man every other man wants to be:  handsome, smart and personable- with the body of a Greek god.  He is on the fast track to the big time after he becomes a Partner of one of Atlanta&#39;s largest and oldest law firms- until his reckless and self-destructive behavior put his career in jeopardy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Everything Comes Around&lt;/b&gt; is a fast-paced, page-turning thrill of a ride that has it all: sex, subterfuge and nail-biting suspense.  At the same time, Forbes explores some of the most pressing social issues of our time: homosexuality, abuse, sexual deception and the cultural phenomenon commonly known as the down-low in a sensitive, humorous, irreverent, but ultimately touching manner that leaves the reader cheering breathlessly.
