  <title>Men in Miami Hotels - Charlie Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Men in Miami Hotels&lt;/em&gt;, Smith tells the story of Cot Sims, a listing Miami gangster who returns to Key West aiming to&amp;#8212;among other things&amp;#8212;save his fool-proof mother from homelessness after a recent hurricane. For love, for cash, and for the hell of it, he snatches a trove of emeralds that his boss, the relentlessly vicious Albertson, keeps hidden on a small island. And then trouble, which has been coiling around him for years like a snake, bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cot has forty-eight hours to return the emeralds before items of equal or greater value&amp;#8212;namely, the lives of everyone he loves&amp;#8212;are repossessed by Albertson and his army of hired gunmen. Fleeing across the Caribbean, Cot blazes a trail of survival, skeltering between the narrowing walls of fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie Smith has been called a novelist of &amp;#34;appalling brilliance&amp;#34; on the cover of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;. Critics have praised his work with the fervor of converts. And his prose, as radiant and dynamic as it has ever been, &amp;#34;lands him in the ranks of America&amp;#39;s greatest contemporary fiction writers&amp;#34; (&lt;em&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;" />
