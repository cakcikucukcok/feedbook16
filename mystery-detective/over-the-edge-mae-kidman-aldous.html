  <title>Over the Edge - Mae Kidman Aldous</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After setting out on a nice drive up the canyon, Cari and her fianc, Michael, were forced over the edge on a roller-coaster ride down the mountain, which ended when their car slammed into a stand of trees. Cari slowly crawled back up the mountain and was shocked to hear vocal promptings of encouragement, even though Michaels lifeless body lay in the wrecked car. His one request was for her to find the person responsible for his death and promised to be at her side when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would someone want to kill them? Will Cari survive, and will she find justice for her fianc? Perhaps, after meeting the young man who found her lying on the side of the road or the detective who didnt believe her story. Possibly, reuniting with a former friend would make the difference. Then there was that nagging fear that her father would carry out his threat to kill her. She discovered that he had been released from prison and barely managed to hold herself together upon meeting him face to face. As Cari travels down this perilous road and faces more danger than she ever anticipated, is it possible for her to find true happiness?&lt;/p&gt;" />
