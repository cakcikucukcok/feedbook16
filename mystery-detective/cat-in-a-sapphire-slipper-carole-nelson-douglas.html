  <title>Cat in a Sapphire Slipper - Carole Nelson Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cat in a Sapphire Slipper&lt;/i&gt; is the twentieth title in Carole Nelson Douglas&#39;s sassy Midnight Louie mystery series. The tough-talking, twenty-pound, tomcat PI is as feisty as ever as he and his gang try to keep his favorite roommate from losing her man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;PR honcho Temple Barr&#39;s romance novelist aunt Kit has wound up in a romantic plot of her own. She&#39;s snagged one of the most eligible bachelors on the Strip, one of the elder Fontana brothers, a silver-tongued reputed ex-mobster with a heart of gold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is to be a wedding...and where there is a wedding there is usually a bachelor party. Things go disastrously wrong when the entire party is hijacked and taken to a remote ranch out in the Nevada desert, a place where the women are wild and the sex is legal. And among the group?  None other than Temple&#39;s own Matt, an ex-priest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truly a fish out of water, he soon comes upon a beautiful young woman who is quite naked and most thoroughly dead. Given the remoteness of the location with very few suspects on hand (plus the Fontanas&#39; shady reputation) this could be a very bad thing indeed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Louie?  Well, he managed to go along for the ride and once again it&#39;s up to that big old tomcat to bail out his humans and save the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cat in a Sapphire Slipper&lt;/i&gt; is a fast-paced, racy mystery with a loveable cast of characters and one terrific tough dude to keep them all in line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
