  <title>Eye of the Moon - Ivan Obolensky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Described as a &amp;quot;gothic mystery of the finest order, &lt;em&gt;Eyes Wide Shut &lt;/em&gt;meets Agatha Christie&amp;quot; (&lt;em&gt;IndieReader&lt;/em&gt;), an &amp;quot;ingeniously constructed... engrossing tale of mystery and magic&amp;quot; (&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt;), &amp;quot;gripping, intense, thorough. Everything I wanted in a thriller, and then some.&amp;quot; (Nick Thacker, bestselling author). &amp;quot;In ambiance it rivals&lt;em&gt; Downton Abbey&lt;/em&gt;, but the plot tells a far more intense and shocking story.&amp;quot; (Tom Hyman, author). &amp;quot;Filled with hidden motives, mysterious relics, and sinister unknowns, &lt;em&gt;Eye of the Moon &lt;/em&gt;evokes the drama of &lt;em&gt;Dynasty &lt;/em&gt;with the atmosphere of Manderley.&amp;quot; (Jennifer Whitman, professional bookseller, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This debut mystery/thriller follows Percy and Johnny, raised like brothers but fractured from a past business deal gone terribly wrong, as they attend a five-day weekend house party celebrating the notable anniversary of Johnny&amp;#39;s parents. The initial concerns laid out in the first chapter swiftly morph into something far more sinister as they discover Johnny&amp;#39;s aunt Alice may have been murdered, and everyone in their party of family, friends, and even the servants have secrets and high-stakes agendas. Suddenly thrust into the center of the maelstrom, Percy has to face demons (literally and figuratively) and discover true friendship, loyalty and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;... Obolensky conjures a remarkably imaginative tale, seamlessly juxtaposing the quotidian and the magical in a way that renders the latter mesmerizingly plausible. Johnny and Percy&amp;rsquo;s headlong march into the occult world that may have destroyed Alice is shockingly inadvisable and yet seems to make sense all the same. In addition, the author has a morbid gift for the description of human turpitude that simultaneously inspires both revulsion and awe... Alice&amp;rsquo;s complex character powerfully emerges as the plot&amp;rsquo;s tonal center, a bewitching amalgam of moral strength, intellectual vitality, and a lust for life. Likewise, Stanley is far more than meets the eye, and Obolensky skillfully portrays him with literary restraint, leaving the reader to deliciously wonder if he&amp;rsquo;s truly a friend or a secret foe... the story as a whole remains a transfixing one, ingeniously constructed.&amp;quot; -&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A gothic mystery set in 1977&amp;mdash;involving the occult, stolen treasure, family secrets, and financial sabotage&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Eye of the Moon&lt;/em&gt; is sumptuous in its description of white-tie dinner parties and sexual tensions with baronesses, and sharp in its maneuvering of several secret puzzles at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When Johnny Dodge knocks on Percy&amp;rsquo;s door and asks him to help uncover whether they&amp;rsquo;ve accidentally drunk the bottles of Ch&amp;acirc;teau Lafite 1959 that Johnny&amp;rsquo;s parents were saving for their anniversary, Percy should have known that more than fine wine would be opened during a weekend in Rhinebeck, the Dodge family estate that always felt a bit peculiar. Soon the best friends are deep in a mystery involving the questionable death of Johnny&amp;rsquo;s aunt Alice, the occult, hidden paternity, and high-stakes financial risk&amp;mdash;all over the course of a weekend party at the unsettling estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The mysteries are finely woven together and readers must think fast on their feet if they hope to keep up with the meticulous minds of the weekend guests. Percy is a capable protagonist for this high-stakes maneuvering, and half of the fun is reading his descriptions of the five-course meals served by Dagmar and the fine liquors decanted by Stanley, who run the house for the Dodges. The style occasionally sounds better fit for the 1940&amp;rsquo;s than the 1970&amp;rsquo;s, but it fits the tone of the book...&amp;quot; -&lt;em&gt;IndieReader, &lt;/em&gt;4.7 stars, IR approved&lt;/p&gt;" />
