  <title>Death of a Dishonorable Gentleman - Tessa Arlen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lady Montfort has been planning her annual summer costume ball for months, and with scrupulous care. Pulling together the food, flowers and a thousand other details for one of the most significant social occasions of the year is her happily accepted responsibility. But when her husband&#39;s degenerate nephew is found murdered, it&#39;s more than the ball that is ruined. In fact, Lady Montfort fears that the official police enquiry, driven by petty snobbery and class prejudice, is pointing towards her son as a potential suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking matters into her own hands, the rather over-imaginative countess enlists the help of her pragmatic housekeeper, Mrs. Jackson, to investigate the case, track down the women that vanished the night of the murder, and clear her son&#39;s name. As the two women search for a runaway housemaid and a headstrong young woman, they unearth the hidden lives of Lady Montfort&#39;s close friends, servants and family and discover the identity of a murderer hiding in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this enchanting debut sure to appeal to fans of &lt;i&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/i&gt;, Tessa Arlen draws readers into a world exclusively enjoyed by the rich, privileged classes and suffered by the men and women who serve them. &lt;i&gt;Death of a Dishonorable Gentleman&lt;/i&gt; is an elegant mystery filled with intriguing characters and fascinating descriptions of Edwardian life--a superb treat for those who love British novels.&lt;/p&gt;" />
