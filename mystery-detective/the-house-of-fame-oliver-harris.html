  <title>The House of Fame - Oliver Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the author of the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;The Hollow Man&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deep Shelter&lt;/em&gt;, comes the third installment featuring the shrewd, cynical, and brilliant London detective, Nick Belsey, whose investigation into a child&amp;#8217;s disappearance pulls him into the hedonistic orbit of a young, hot celebrity actress/musician and the dark world lurking underneath its glamorous exterior.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seven, rich and beautiful, Amber Knight is living everyone&amp;#8217;s dream. Her music career is established, her acting career is taking off, and she has a lifestyle fit for the top of the A-List. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;So why has she started acting so strangely? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;At least, that&amp;#8217;s how it seems to Nick Belsey. A less celebrated resident of North London, Belsey&amp;#8217;s decade-long career at Hampstead CID is coming to an abrupt end, but he still can&amp;#8217;t seem to kick his habit of getting into serious trouble. When he&amp;#8217;s asked by a desperate mother to help find her only son, Belsey has to infiltrate Amber&amp;#8217;s glittering world. The seedy underside to her seemingly perfect life&amp;#8212;a realm of excess, obsession, lust, and greed&amp;#8212;doesn&amp;#8217;t surprise him. What does is the blood trail that leads directly to Amber. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one twisted crime is followed by another, Belsey finds himself chasing even more answers than when he started out. And when the stakes are raised dangerously high, Belsey&amp;#8217;s own survival is at stake. It may be too late to save his reputation but he&amp;#8217;s not ready to die just yet&amp;#8212;and especially not at the hands of a celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Harris has a terrific sense of place, hurtling between the wealthiest and most-run-down areas of London. But the cleverest thing about his third Belsey novel is the way the plot unfolds in a chilling and totally unexpected direction.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; (London)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
