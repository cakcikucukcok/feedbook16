  <title>Ravages of Greed - R. W. Doyen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Conrad Shore became lost in the enormity and horrors of a war he never understood. He had put his life on the line for his country and his comrades more times than he could count, and his selfless acts of bravery had earned him a great deal of respect. Now, home after two tours of dutyhes lost. The ribbons and medals he earned are painful reminders of a place and time hed sooner forget. That was a different time, and he is now a different man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the war, he left his wife, Hannah, and their infant daughter, Dana, behind. For years, hes wandered the country in search of a stability he cant accurately define. Drawn back to rejoin the family he never stopped loving, Conrad must now face the many wounds to body and soul his warrior past burned into him. With Hannahs help, he hopes he can start a new life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hes always been good with his hands, so he starts a thriving construction business. But even that dream slips through his calloused hands, as the economy crushes his prospects. Conrad fights for optimism and a reason to keep fighting for his future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is during this dark time that he crosses paths with Manuel Estrada, a greed-driven killer who would stop at nothing to keep what he feels belongs to him. The unremitting greed of these two different men generates a caustic and unrelenting war that threatens to destroy all within its path.&lt;/p&gt;" />
