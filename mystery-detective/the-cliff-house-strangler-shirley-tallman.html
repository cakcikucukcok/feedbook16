  <title>The Cliff House Strangler - Shirley Tallman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nineteenth-century attorney Sarah Woolson is still trying to get her life together. Against her family&#39;s wishes, she opens her own San Francisco law firm, only to find that clients---paying clients, that is---are wary of allowing a woman to manage their legal affairs. Just when her patience, as well as her money, are about to run out, Sarah and her friend and former colleague, Robert Campbell, attend a séance at San Francisco&#39;s Cliff House. Making their way through the worst storm of the season, they arrive at their destination to find themselves in for much more than, in Robert&#39;s words, &quot;silly parlor tricks.&quot; After a dramatic display of spirit apparitions, flying trumpets, and phantom music, Madame Olga Karpova---a renowned Russian clairvoyant---and her guests make a grisly discovery: One of the twelve people seated at the table has been brutally strangled.&lt;br&gt;Later, when two more séance participants are found slain, Sarah is pressed into defending the accused murderer. Working on her client&#39;s case, she quickly finds herself at the center of a complicated murder plot involving ghosts, gypsies, and City Hall, all the while facing off with Robert in a volatile legal battle and investigating her brother Frederick&#39;s shady political dealings. Hardly proper behavior for a nineteenth-century woman, but Sarah wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.&lt;br&gt;Feisty and determined, Sarah continues to flout the notions of &quot;proper&quot; femininity in this series that is a turn-of-the-century answer to &lt;i&gt;Legally Blonde.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
