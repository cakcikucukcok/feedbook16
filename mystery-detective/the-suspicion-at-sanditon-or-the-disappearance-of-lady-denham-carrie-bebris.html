  <title>The Suspicion at Sanditon (Or, The Disappearance of Lady Denham) - Carrie Bebris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Suspicion at Sanditon, &lt;/i&gt;the next adventure in Carrie Bebris&#39;s award-winning Mr. &amp; Mrs. Darcy Mystery series takes Fitzwilliam and Elizabeth Darcy to Sanditon, the setting of Jane Austen&#39;s final work. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There, accompanied by their friend Miss Charlotte Heywood, they encounter an array of eccentric villagers and visitors. Among Sanditon&#39;s most prominent residents: Lady Denham, a childless, twice-widowed dowager with a fortune to bequeath and a flight of distant relations circling for a place in her will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Darcys have scarcely settled into their lodgings when Lady Denham unexpectedly invites them to a dinner party. Thirteen guests assemble at Sanditon House-but their hostess never appears. As a violent storm rises, a search for Lady Denham begins. The Darcys, like most of their fellow attendees, speculate that one of her ladyship&#39;s would-be heirs has grown impatient .?.?. until the guests start to vanish one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does a kidnapper lurk in the centuries-old mansion, or is a still more sinister force at work? As the night grows short, the dwelling&#39;s population grows thin, and tales of Sanditon House&#39;s storied past emerge, Mr. and Mrs. Darcy find themselves leading a desperate effort to discover what has happened to Lady Denham and the missing guests, before they all-perhaps even Elizabeth and Darcy themselves-disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Regency era&#39;s answer to Nick and Nora Charles, the Darcys once again demonstrate their quick wits and signature wit as they search for the truth-universally acknowledged and otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
