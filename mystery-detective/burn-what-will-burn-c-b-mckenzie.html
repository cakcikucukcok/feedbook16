  <title>Burn What Will Burn - C. B. McKenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Burn What Will Burn&lt;/i&gt; is a gritty, gripping mystery and an enthralling character study of its poet-protagonist, who is self-exiled and bedeviled by the locals, the summer Arkansas heat, and his own past. I was hooked by sentence one and burned right through the pages.&quot;--Michael Kardos, author of &lt;i&gt;Before He Finds Her&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob Reynolds doesn&#39;t recognize the body in the creek, but he does recognize the danger of it. He&#39;s a newcomer to town, not entirely welcome, and not entirely on good footing with the sheriff. So far he&#39;s kept his head down, mostly over the bar at the Crow&#39;s Nest. But he has interests other than drinking and spending his inheritance, including one that goes by the name Tammy Fay Smith and who may have caught the sheriff&#39;s eye as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reynolds would rather pretend he never saw the body, but when it disappears, he begins to doubt what little he knew about this secretive town, a town that seems to become more unwelcoming by the day. Try as he might, he just can&#39;t forget the body, despite the advice he&#39;s been given to do so, and despite the evidence to suggest that he might be disappearing himself soon enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his acclaimed, award-winning debut, &lt;i&gt;Burn What Will Burn &lt;/i&gt;confirms CB McKenzie as a one-of-a-kind crime novelist with an unforgettably original voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
