When Hooten dies due to his injuries, as bad as they feel about it, there is little that they can do. However, the dead man&#39;s mother--a widow to a brutal mobster--wastes no time making a call to an old associate to settle the score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an assassin on his way, the FBI close behind, and a new P.I. bringing up the rear, Moon and Parris will need to watch their backs in Doss&#39;s raucous addition to his wild and witty western mystery series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
