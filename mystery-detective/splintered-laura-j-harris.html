  <title>Splintered - Laura J Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A simple, relaxing, all-inclusive Caribbean cruise turns out to be anything but, as the luxury ship is sabotaged and chaos and isolation swiftly turn to mistrust, mayhem and murder...
Contemplating early retirement following the horrific and high-profile death of her sister and the media hounding that followed, Criminal Psychologist and Profiler, Dr. Christine Kane embarks on a get-away cruise that will prove to be the vacation of a lifetime for all the wrong reasons.
Ex-DI Jonathan Prior is now the Head of Security on board the luxury ocean-liner, Ianus, and despite his initial reservations, he seems to have found love in the most unlikely of places. He is happy. For the first time in a long time. Though even bliss such as this can&#39;t keep the nightmares of his past at bay for long.
Kelly Livingstone is the Artist in Residence at Leeds University. A talented woman with a tortured past, she lives her life for the here and now and to hell with the consequences! That is until the university force her to take her annual leave and concentrate on creating some biographical nonsense for publication. Kelly promises herself she won&#39;t fall in love on this trip, but with so many beautiful and intelligent women surrounding her, can she really keep her word... and should she?
With so many twists and turns, a frenzied pace and a real sense of the panic of containment and isolation, SPLINTERED is an energized escape into the world of an unknown assassin on the verge of transition and self-discovery with only one thing on their mind...murder." />
