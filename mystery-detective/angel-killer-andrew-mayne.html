  <title>Angel Killer - Andrew Mayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this self-published bestselling e-book by a real illusionist&amp;#8212;the first thriller in a sensational series&amp;#8212;now available in paperback, FBI agent Jessica Blackwood believes she has successfully left her complicated life as a gifted magician behind her . . . until a killer with seemingly supernatural powers puts her talents to the ultimate test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mysterious hacker, who identifies himself only as &amp;#8220;Warlock,&amp;#8221; brings down the FBI&amp;#8217;s website and posts a code in its place. It hides the GPS coordinates of a Michigan cemetery, where a dead girl is discovered rising from the ground . . . as if she tried to crawl out of her own grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born into a dynasty of illusionists, Jessica Blackwood is destined to become its next star&amp;#8212;until she turns her back on her troubled family, and her legacy, to begin a new life in law enforcement. But FBI consultant Dr. Jeffrey Ailes&amp;#8217;s discovery of an old copy of &lt;em&gt;Magician Magazine&lt;/em&gt; will turn Jessica&amp;#8217;s carefully constructed world upside down. Faced with a crime that appears beyond explanation, Ailes has nothing to lose&amp;#8212;and everything to gain&amp;#8212;by taking a chance on an agent raised in a world devoted to seemingly achieving the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body in the cemetery is only the first in the Warlock&amp;#8217;s series of dark miracles. Thrust into the media spotlight, with time ticking away until the next crime, can Jessica confront her past to embrace her gifts and stop a depraved killer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she can&amp;#8217;t, she may become his next victim.&lt;/p&gt;" />
