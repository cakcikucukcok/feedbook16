  <title>The Silver Chariot Killer: The Lindsey &amp; Plum Detective Series, Book Six - Richard A. Lupoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WHEN A MAN&#39;S PARTNER IS KILLED... So begins one of the most famous quotations in all of crime fiction. And just as the murder of Sam Spade&#39;s partner, Miles Archer, sets off the quest in the great Dashiell Hammett&#39;s greatest novel, so the murder of Hobart Lindsey&#39;s partner, Cletus Berry, sets off the quest in The Silver Chariot Killer, the sixth of Richard A. Lupoff&#39;s classic series of &quot;Killer&quot; mysteries. It&#39;s Christmas week in New York and Cletus Berry&#39;s body has been found literally frozen in the ice in an alley in Hell&#39;s Kitchen, a black circle marking the entry wound of the bullet that scrambled Berry&#39;s brain and ended his life. This wouldn&#39;t normally be Lindsey&#39;s case, but &quot;When a man&#39;s partner is killed, he&#39;s supposed to do something about it.&quot; Earlier novels in the series built a popular following for Hobart Lindsey and Marvia Plum. Now Lindsey is on his own and on alien turf, and the action grows darker as Lindsey&#39;s world grows colder. The Silver Chariot Killer is a case unlike any that Lindsey has faced in the past, and unlike any that the reader is likely to have encountered until now. Great crime fiction by a master storyteller!" />
