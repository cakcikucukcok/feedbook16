  <title>Deadly Visions - Gabriele Jex</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DEADLY VISIONS is the story of Ariel DeMattei, a very successful but selfish woman who uses people for her own gain.  Using money she inherited after the death of her adoptive parents, Ariel and her friend Lisa open their own health club, &quot;Heavenly Bodies&quot;.  The club does well but Ariel decides that replacing her partner with a beautiful celebrity would enhance the clubs prestige.
 After buying out her partner and dumping her latest boyfriend, whose marriage she broke up, Ariel suffers a near-fatal automobile accident.  While on the operating table, she has an out-of-body experience that leaves her shaken.  As she recovers, she experiences a bizarre mental phenomenon.
Visions of a murdered homeless woman shed seen on her way to work one morning begin to haunt her until she finally sees the murder itself, and the man who committed it.  After helping the police find the man, she feels relieved that the visions are finally over.  But they are not; theyve been replaced by an even more terrifying one.
Busy with plans to open a second health club, Ariel is unaware of the man who is watching her every move.  Not until she begins receiving strange gifts and threatening notes does she realize the danger she is in.  This, coupled with the images of murder, brings her to the brink of a nervous breakdown.
Desperate for help, Ariel consults a psychic and plans to visit the parapsychology department at the local university.  But on the way out of her apartment building she makes a shocking discovering and soon finds her own life in peril!" />
