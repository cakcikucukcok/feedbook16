But when a fellow military wife turns up dead, Ellie tackles a different type of case--murder.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellie Avery balances motherhood, marriage, and her own business--Everything in Its Place--with cheerful efficiency. A maestro of organization, she sees her life as an easy checklist that does not include the untimely death of Penny Follette.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike the police, Ellie isn&#39;t convinced Penny&#39;s death was suicide.

Poking about in closets and peeking through drawers, Ellie hopes to find the common thread tying the crimes together. With her husband Mitch about to be deployed in the &quot;sandbox&quot; (that&#39;s the Mideast for us civvies), she wants some quality time with her significant other. As the schedule tightens and the mystery heightens, Ellie&#39;s out to prove that home is not for killers!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Filled with Ellie Avery&#39;s Great Organizing Tips*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Plenty of action and lots of suspects and clues.  .  .this is a mystery with a &#39;mommy lit&#39; flavor.
