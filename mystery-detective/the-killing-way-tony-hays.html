  <title>The Killing Way - Tony Hays</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the time of Arthur, but this is not his storied epic. Arthur is a young and powerful warrior who some would say stands on the brink of legend. Britain&#39;s leaders have come to elect a new supreme king, and Arthur is favored. But when a young woman is brutally murdered and the blame is placed at Merlin&#39;s feet, Arthur&#39;s reputation is at stake and his enemies are poised to strike. Arthur turns to Malgwyn ap Cuneglas, a man whose knowledge of battle and keen insight into how the human mind works has helped Arthur come to the brink of kingship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malgwyn is also the man who hates Arthur most in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the death of Malgwyn&#39;s wife by Saxon hands, he became Mad Malgwyn, killer of Saxons and right-hand lieutenant to the warrior Arthur. Right hand, that is, until a Saxon cut his sword arm off and left him to die on the battlefield. Arthur rescued him. Now a one-armed scribe and a heavy drinker, Malgwyn rejects the half-life that his liege gave him. But loyalty is sometimes stronger than loathing...and Malgwyn is pulled toward a puzzle that he can&#39;t walk away from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think &lt;i&gt;CSI:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Medieval&lt;/i&gt;: gritty, powerful, and with the true ring of historical perspective and a character who sees more than those around him. &lt;i&gt;The Killing Way&lt;/i&gt; is the first in a mystery series that is sure to be a hit with both mystery readers and historical fans alike.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
