      <meta name="description" content="Rhinos are being poached from a Private Game Reserve and Jack Delaney and his team are called in to investigate and put a stop to this blight. There is little time to waste and the non-stop action moves from the offices of the owners of the Big 5 Game Reserves into the bushveld setting of the Game reserve. Crocodile and hippo infested rivers become potential murder weapons as a Game Ranger is kidnapped - and murder, too, rears its ugly head.&lt;br /&gt;

The mob are ruthless in their attempts to take over control of a Private Game Reserve so that they can use it as a staging post for their smuggling and poaching activities, and the battle for control comes to a head in the dark of an African night in and amongst the crocodiles and hippos in a river bed." />
