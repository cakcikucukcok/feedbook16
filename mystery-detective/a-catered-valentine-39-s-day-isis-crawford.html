  <title>A Catered Valentine&#39;s Day - Isis Crawford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bernie and Libby, owners of A Taste of Heaven, have plans to partner up with the Just Chocolate store for a taste-tempting Valentine&#39;s Day fundraiser featuring pairings of exotic chocolates, food, and wine, as well as a bachelor auction. And though Bernie isn&#39;t too happy about her boyfriend volunteering to be auctioned off, she&#39;s got too much on her plate to be jealous: one of the coolers is leaking; they need a new butter supplier, and the mother of a very good client has died.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Putting their preparations on hold, Bernie and Libby attend the funeral, only to be recruited to help solve a mystery. In an old cemetery-turned-lover&#39;s-lane, the body of Ted Gorman has been found in someone else&#39;s grave. The same Ted Gorman who supposedly died in a fiery car crash weeks earlier.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Ted was the owner&amp;#8211;with his wife&amp;#8211;of Just Chocolate. So now, as Bernie and Libby continue working with the grieving widow, they open up a mixed box of dark financial scandal, sticky family ties, bittersweet passion, and just desserts.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;b&gt;  Includes Scrumptious Dessert Recipes for You to Try!  &lt;/b&gt;" />
