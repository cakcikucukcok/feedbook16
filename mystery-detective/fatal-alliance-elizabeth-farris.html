  <title>Fatal Alliance - Elizabeth Farris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When two college football players are reunited a few years after graduating a couple years apart, it seemed as though fate might deal them both a great hand. One went on to make a fortune in the stock market. The other, slated for NFL greatness unfortunately ended up on skid row after an injury ended his football career. 
But after a chance encounter, the two men end up teaming up once again. BJ, the billionaire, takes Jake (his buddy) under his wing and introduces him to a world of lavish excess beyond Jakes wildest imagination. However, BJ has a dark side hidden beneath his extreme wealth. 
Will the brotherly bond the two men once again share be able to withstand the horrible deeds of one of them? Will the alliance that was built on trust and love be torn down by deceit and betrayal? One woman stands in the balance." />
