      <meta name="description" content="The Lane Fleming collection of early pistols and revolvers was one of the best in the country. When Fleming was found dead on the floor of his locked gunroom, a Confederate-made Colt-type percussion .36 revolver in his hand, the coroner&amp;#39;s verdict was &amp;quot;death by accident.&amp;quot; But Gladys Fleming had her doubts. Enough at any rate to engage Colonel Jefferson Davis Rand&amp;mdash;better known just as Jeff&amp;mdash;private detective and a pistol-collector himself, to catalogue, appraise, and negotiate the sale of her late husband&amp;#39;s collection.&lt;br /&gt;
There were a number of people who had wanted the collection. The question was: had anyone wanted it badly enough to kill Fleming? And if so, how had he done it? Here is a mystery, told against the fascinating background of old guns and gun-collecting, which is rapid-fire without being hysterical, exciting without losing its contact with reason, and which introduces a personable and intelligent new private detective.
