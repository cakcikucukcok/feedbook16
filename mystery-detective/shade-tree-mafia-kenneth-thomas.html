      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a Civil War on the horizon, and this time it&amp;rsquo;s not the U.S. Government. The South&amp;rsquo;s most powerful family in Organized Crime is about to lose its leader &amp;ldquo;Martin Delruso&amp;rdquo; to terminal cancer. Afraid to leave behind his daughter &amp;ldquo;Rebecca Delruso&amp;rdquo; and wife &amp;ldquo;Sharon Delruso&amp;rdquo; at the mercy of the New York Mafia, it&amp;rsquo;s urgent that he find the son of his maid that passed away 25 years earlier. &amp;ldquo;Adrian Delruso&amp;rdquo; was adopted and raised by the Delruso family as one of their own but the powerful New York Mafia would rather go to war than answer to their new leader. The Delruso&amp;rsquo;s know they cannot win a war against the North when the families combine as one, so &amp;ldquo;Adrian Delruso&amp;rdquo; makes an alliance no one will ever see coming. The son of a maid, poor adopted black kid from the south &amp;ldquo;Adrian Delruso&amp;rdquo; who is now the most powerful man in the Mafia and the son of a drug addict, poor white foster kid from the South who is now the most powerful man in the Aryan Brotherhood &amp;ldquo;Hard Rain&amp;rdquo; are on a collision course with the five Mafia families of New York&lt;/p&gt;" />
