  <title>Death in Chicago a Sanctuary City - Brian McCann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One quiet Sunday afternoon, Pat McGurn receives a shocking recorded phone call from the Cook County jail in Illinois informing him that his brother&#39;s killer has been released from custody. Pat can&#39;t believe it. None of it makes sense. His brother, Denny, was run down, killed by not only a man who is an illegal alien but also a convicted felonand now the man is walking free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death in Chicago is a narrative of Pat McGurn&#39;s brother&#39;s death and the glaring misdeeds of so called justice. Over the course of twenty-five days, Pat fights to keep Denny&#39;s killer behind bars, Denny had only been gone two months following the tragedy in Logan Square on Chicago&#39;s north side. How could the man responsible for his death be allowed to leave the country?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeper Pat digs into the case, the more he comes to realize the decision to release Denny&#39;s killer is completely political and orchestrated by the Cook County Board of Commissioners. He won&#39;t let them get away with blood on their handshis brother&#39;s blood. He&#39;ll find a way to return justice with the help of Viet Nam Marine veterans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
