  <title>1986-2026 Generation of the Fig Tree - Leslie Lucas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The main characters are Turner Thompson, his wife Barbara and their two children along with their pastor in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner is engaged in the high tech field of communications. Barbara is a key member of the international business community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turner is one of the brightest minds in the area of cryptography and works in an elite group of information gatherers that endeavor to protect the United States from terrorist threats. He is an expert in seeing patterns in actions and words. He is proficient in solving problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a deeply spiritual person and his Bible studies lead him into the area of Biblical Prophecy and to the absolute ultimate in problems. However, he is able to see the answers to the enigmatic time frames posed by the prophet Daniel in concert with Jesus and the Apostle Paul. He finds the key that identifies the &quot;last day of the Lord&quot; and the time frame it occupies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader accompanies Turner on his journey in the sophisticated world of U.S. Intelligence and is led step by step into the knowledge of the staggering importance of the forty years framed by the years 1986 and 2026. One experiences a wide range of emotions when confronted with the understanding of the present time in relation to the truth of Biblical revelation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
