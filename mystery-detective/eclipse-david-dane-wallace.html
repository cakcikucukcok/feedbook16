  <title>Eclipse - David Dane Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cameron Mills was an American Icon. He had it all, a Family with money, a beautiful girl friend and a talent for Martial Arts that most Legends could only dream of. He was world renowned, idolized and feared by his enemies. He was a monarch, and someone that the masses respected, until one day, that all changed with the stroke of a knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Cameron Pony Boy Mills has been charged with the murder of his girl friend and another man whose lives were taken by a shadowy figure that is thought to be him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People loved him, idolized him and respected him. He was revered, and now amidst a media storm and the friendship of a Famous Mobster he has become known as The Anti Hero. There are no more hugs and adoring Fans, no more people begging for autographs, and a world that once loved him wants to see him receive the death penalty in Brighton Californias lethal injection chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ECLIPSE - WELCOME TO BRIGHTON CITY - THE PLACE WHERE THE WICKED COME TO PARTY.&lt;/p&gt;
