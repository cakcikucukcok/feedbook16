  <title>My Friend The Murderer -  Arthur Conan Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Number 481 is no better, doctor,&amp;quot; said the head-warder, in a slightly reproachful accent, looking in round the corner of my door. &amp;quot;Confound 481&amp;quot; I responded from behind the pages of the Australian Sketcher. &amp;quot;And 61 says his tubes are paining him. Couldn&amp;#39;t you do anything for him?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;He is a walking drug-shop,&amp;quot; said I. &amp;quot;He has the whole British pharmacopa&amp;aelig; inside him. I believe his tubes are as sound as yours are.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Then there&amp;#39;s 7 and 108, they are chronic,&amp;quot; continued the warder, glancing down a blue slip of paper. &amp;quot;And 28 knocked off work yesterday&amp;mdash;said lifting things gave him a stitch in the side. I want you to have a look at him, if you don&amp;#39;t mind, doctor. There&amp;#39;s 81, too&amp;mdash;him that killed John Adamson in the Corinthian brig&amp;mdash;he&amp;#39;s been carrying on awful in the night, shrieking and yelling, he has, and no stopping him either.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;All right, I&amp;#39;ll have a look at him afterward,&amp;quot; I said, tossing my paper carelessly aside, and pouring myself out a cup of coffee. &amp;quot;Nothing else to report, I suppose, warder?&amp;quot; The official protruded his head a little further into the room. &amp;quot;Beg pardon, doctor,&amp;quot; he said, in a confidential tone, &amp;quot;but I notice as 82 has a bit of a cold, and it would be a good excuse for you to visit him and have a chat, maybe.&amp;quot; The cup of coffee was arrested half-way to my lips as I stared in amazement at the man&amp;#39;s serious face." />
