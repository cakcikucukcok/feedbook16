  <title>Shades of Blue - Kenny Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;New York City Police Department Internal Affairs Sergeant Charlie Weadock confronts the three biggest challenges of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYPD has ordered him to work with Detective Lieutenant Vincent Kennedy to track down a serial killer known only as Ramon. Weadock believes Ramon is an active police officer, but Kennedy does not. Their investigation is complex and fiery because they grew up on the same Manhattan Street, and they hate each other for personal reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While pursuing the Ramon case, Weadock acquires information pertaining to a large group of drug-dealing cops. He wants to snare this entire group of rouge cops at a planned house party in Staten Island, but City Hall hears of this case and bullies him to close it with the arrest of just one cop to avoid a major scandal. He resists their harassment, but this second major case impedes his pursuit of Ramon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Theresa Kennedy has returned home and ignites a romance with Charlie Weadock that was crushed ten years earlier by her older brother, Vincent, and hardnosed police father Joe. This romance infuriates some of the Kennedy clan who line up against the two lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mystery novel, &lt;i&gt;Shades of Blue&lt;/i&gt; explores the cops blue code of silence and beyond the political tampering to reveal the real criminals who wear police uniforms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
