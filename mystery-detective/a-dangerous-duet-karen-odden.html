  <title>A Dangerous Duet - Karen Odden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the New Mexico-Arizona Book Award for Historical Fiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This dazzling new Victorian mystery from &lt;em&gt;USA Today &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author Karen Odden introduces readers to Nell Hallam, a determined young pianist who stumbles upon the operations of a notorious&amp;#8212;and deadly&amp;#8212;crime ring while illicitly working as the piano player in a Soho music hall. Perfect for readers of Tasha Alexander, Anne Perry, and Deanna Raybourn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen-year-old Nell Hallam lives in a modest corner of Mayfair with her brother Matthew, an inspector at Scotland Yard. An exceptionally talented pianist, she aspires to attend the Royal Academy; but with tuition beyond their means, Nell sets out to earn the money herself&amp;#8212;by playing piano in a popular Soho music hall. And the fact that she will have to disguise herself as a man and slip out at night to do it doesn&amp;#8217;t deter her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending evenings at the Octavian is like entering an alternate world, one of lively energy, fascinating performers, raucous patrons&amp;#8212;and dark secrets. And when Nell stumbles upon the operations of an infamous crime ring&amp;#160;working in the shadows of the music hall, she is drawn&amp;#160;into a conspiracy that stretches the length of London. To further complicate matters, she has begun to fall for&amp;#160;the hall owner&#39;s charismatic son, Jack, who has secrets of his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more Nell becomes a part of the Octavian&amp;#8217;s world, the more she risks the relationships with the people she loves. And when another performer is left for dead in an alley as a warning, she realizes her future could be in jeopardy in more ways than one.&lt;/p&gt;" />
