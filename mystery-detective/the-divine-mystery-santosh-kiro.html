  <title>The Divine Mystery - Santosh Kiro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A mysterious phenomenon strikes a forested hamlet inhabited by tribal people. A scientific organisation in Mumbai thinks that studying the phenomenon may open up floodgates of knowledge to some new source of energy. It commissions Veer, a brilliant but agnostic young scinetist, who since childhood has been getting unfathomable weird dreams of a village, to collect samples.
When Veer prepares to go back after collecting samples, another mysterious incident takes place, this time with himself. Awed but thrilled, he postpones his return journey and upon initial probing, finds that Lord Hanuman once roamed about in this hamlet. Veer sets out on a long journey to unearth his mysterious childhood dreams which, he now is sure, were actually linked with this village. As he delves in more, he comes across thrilling facts and myths on Hanuman, Lord Shiva, Linga and Yoni, all intricately linked with the tribal inhabitants here, and many of his childhood dreams start making sens. But what he finally discovers is a world beyond common beliefs" />
