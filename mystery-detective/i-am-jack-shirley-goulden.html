  <title>I Am Jack - Shirley Goulden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The mysterious murders of several prostitutes in Londons East End in 1888 still exist as some of the most famous unsolved crimes of all time. The purported villain was known as Jack the Ripper. Yet, Jack was never discovered. His identity was never brought to light, and authorities were left scratching their heads in wonderment. How could such a monster get away undetectedeven to this day?
Perhaps he didnt. Perhaps Jack the Ripper was actually known by another name: Dr. Thomas Neill Cream. Cream was hanged for the murder of a number of prostitutes, yet his method differed greatly from that of the Ripper, so no one made the connection. Cream used poison, while Jack the Ripper slit the throats of his victims. But then why, just before Cream was hanged, did he whisper, I am Jack?
Following ten years of research, Shirley Goulden presents what she considers to be the truth of Jack the Rippers identity. She believes that despite a claimed alibi, Dr. Cream truly was the infamous murderer. Firsthand accounts and evidence of a prison pay-off speak to Creams guilt. Was the most famous escaped serial killer actually caught? Or did a monster still walk the streets of London long after the last drop of blood was spilled?" />
