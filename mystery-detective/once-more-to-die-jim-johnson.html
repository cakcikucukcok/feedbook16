      <meta name="description" content="Retired hitman and gangster, escaped convict, former Marine, outlaw biker, and French Foreign Legionnaire Tommy Atkins is hiding out in the Florida Everglades. When a chance encounter leads him to rescue beautiful freedom blogger Maria Elena from rape and murder, they find themselves on the run from a rogue ex-pat Cuban anti-revolutionary militia group, the U.S. Marshal Service, a CIA and FBI joint task force, an infamous Mexican hitman, and the Tampa and Las Vegas Mafia. Their only hope is to fight their way across the country to try to resolve the militia group to which Maria Elena is heir. Along the way, Atkins teaches Elena Maria the lethal arts and how to survive in his underground world--abilities they must put to good use. Only the fact that he is one of the most dangerous men in the world has kept them alive. The prize at the end of their road? Nothing less than controlling all commerce with Cuba as the Castro brothers regime comes to an end! But only if they live long enough to see the payoff..." />
