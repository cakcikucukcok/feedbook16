  <title>Search and Rescue - Gail Anderson-Dargatz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a young woman goes missing on a nature trail, small-town journalist Claire Abbott is first on the scene, as usual. The clues to the woman’s whereabouts are misleading, but Claire has a sixth sense—what the fire chief calls a &quot;radar for crime.&quot; Trusting her intuition, Claire insists that the search and rescue team look elsewhere for clues to the woman’s disappearance. When they fail to follow up on her lead, she pursues it on her own, embarking on a snowy chase up a mountainside that puts herself and others in danger. She’s more than just a journalist chasing a story. Claire is determined to do the right thing at any cost.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Search and Rescue&lt;/i&gt; is the first novel in a series of mysteries featuring journalist and sleuth Claire Abbott." />
