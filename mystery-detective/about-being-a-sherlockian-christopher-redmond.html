  <title>About Being a Sherlockian - Christopher Redmond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who is a Sherlockian? And how does one join the ranks of Sherlockians?
&lt;P&gt;
In &quot;About Being a Sherlockian,&quot; sixty essays explore what it is to be a Sherlockian and celebrate the enduring friendships created. From collecting to chronology, from cosplay to cons, from quasi-historical interpretations to pastiches and fan-fiction, the umbrella of Being a Sherlockian covers a myriad of interests and enthusiasms.
&lt;P&gt;
Editor Christopher Redmond says: &quot;Perhaps most of the readers will be those who are already Sherlockians, but if the book should fall into the hands of someone who is not, I think it will give a very appealing picture of the endless riches to be found in What It Is We Do.&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
&quot;Dip a toe, or even a whole foot into the world of Sherlockian fervor with this extraordinary book which illuminates the life-changing benefits of deep involvement with Holmes, Watson and their world. Les Klinger made me &#39;come out&#39; as a Sherlockian and my world is richer for it, as it is for the candid writers of this wonderful and surprising collection of essays.&quot; —Bonnie MacBird, author of &quot;Art in the Blood&quot; and &quot;Unquiet Spirits&quot;" />
