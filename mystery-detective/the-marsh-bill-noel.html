  <title>The Marsh - Bill Noel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chris Landrums morning has already started on a down note, as he stands in a cemetery listening to the eulogy for a friend. But his entire day deteriorates rapidly when he hears that a murder victim has been found in the marsh behind his retirement home on Folly Beach, South Carolina. Worse yet, the victim is the business associate of one of his friends. In a matter of hours, Chriss quiet, relaxed life is turned upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police are convinced that Sean Aker, the victims law partner, is the killer. Chris has no reason to disagree other than the fact Sean is a frienda feeble defense at best. With the help of a group consisting of a tagalong buddy and wannabe private detective; an aging hippy and surf shop owner; a has-been country music singer; and a new acquaintance who runs a marsh tour business, Chris is thrust into a murder investigation that soon puts his dream of spending an idyllic retirement on hold yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chris and his merry band of misfit friends stumble, bumble, and come face-to-face with death in their amateurish quest to find a killer, they all wonder if the golden years are like this for everyoneor just them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
