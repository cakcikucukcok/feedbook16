  <title>Killer Vacation in San Diego - Kym Datura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rachel was standing in front of her closet trying to decide what to wear. Gavin had slid out from under the bed and quietly walked up behind Rachel. He grabbed her around the throat with his arm and had her in a choke hold. He pressed the knife against her cheek and told her that if she screamed, he would slash her throat.     She was terrified and listened to what he had said. He walked her over to her windows and closed them. &quot;We can&#39;t have anyone hearing us from out there.&quot; He whispered in her ear. He closed the curtains and then locked her door. Her towel had fallen off and she was completely naked. Gavin then took his wire and wrapped it around her wrists behind her back. &quot;If you scream or make any noise, I will kill you and your friends too, do you understand?&quot; He asked her.    Rachel nodded, &quot;Y..y..es.&quot; She let out a little cry. &quot;Please don&#39;t hurt me or kill me. I have money in my purse you can have.&quot; She whispered trying to hold back her tears of fright." />
