  <title>The Dagger Before Me - Heather Haven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Persephone &amp;lsquo;Percy&amp;rsquo; Cole joins the ranks of other gumshoes such as Sam Spade, Lew Archer, and Phillip Marlowe.&amp;nbsp;This five-foot eleven, full-figured gal has the same hard-boiled, take-no-prisoners attitude, but with a difference. She&amp;rsquo;s a shamus with a wicked sense of humor and&amp;nbsp;the mother of an eight-year old son.&amp;nbsp;Halloween, 1942, finds Percy&amp;nbsp;Cole backstage during the previews of the latest Broadway production of Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;Macbeth&lt;/strong&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s double, double, toil and trouble when an actor falls from an overhead catwalk and breaks his neck. Only the latest in a series of catastrophes, his death serves to further fuel the lore and superstition surrounding the Scottish play and its supernatural force since the play&amp;#39;s creation in 1606. With a shortage of &amp;lsquo;man&amp;rsquo; power due to the war overseas, the desperate producer takes a chance on the female PI to save the show from closing. But everyone has their secrets, from the director on down to the lowliest spear thrower. One more murder and a near death scene for Percy, and she&amp;rsquo;s not sure which is worse &amp;ndash; that someone is trying to kill her or being foisted into the role of Witch Number Two. Armed with her noodle and a WWI German Mauser, Persephone Cole will make things right, because that&amp;rsquo;s what lady dicks do.&lt;/p&gt;" />
