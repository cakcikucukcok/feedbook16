  <title>All That Followed - Gabriel Urza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A bold, stunning book...The reader is drawn in not because we want to find out what happened, but &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it happened...&quot;--&lt;i&gt;NPR&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A psychologically twisting novel about a politically-charged act of violence that echoes through a small Spanish town; a debut novel that the &lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review &lt;/i&gt;calls &quot;a triumph.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 2004 in Muriga, a quiet town in Spain&#39;s northern Basque Country, a place with more secrets than inhabitants. Five years have passed since the kidnapping and murder of a young local politician-a family man and father-and the town&#39;s rhythms have almost returned to normal. But in the aftermath of the Atocha train bombings in Madrid, an act of terrorism that rocked a nation and a world, the townspeople want a reckoning of Muriga&#39;s own troubled past: Everyone knows who pulled the trigger five years ago, but is the young man now behind bars the only one to blame? &lt;i&gt;All That Followed&lt;/i&gt; peels away the layers of a crime complicated by history, love, and betrayal. The accounts of three townspeople in particular-the councilman&#39;s beautiful young widow, the teenage radical now in jail for the crime, and an aging American teacher hiding a traumatic past of his own-hold the key to what really happened. And for these three, it&#39;s finally time to confront what they can find of the truth.&lt;br&gt;Inspired by a true story, &lt;i&gt;All That Followed&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful, multifaceted novel about a nefarious kind of violence that can take hold when we least expect. Urgent, elegant, and gorgeously atmospheric, Urza&#39;s debut is a book for the world we live in now, and it marks the arrival of a brilliant new writer to watch.&lt;/p&gt;" />
