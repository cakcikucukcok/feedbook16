  <title>The Vale - Oliver Lewis Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On Monday, a body is found hanging from a tree in a local park. On Tuesday there are two. On Wednesday there are three... Somebody&#39;s going around killing bad people. The police are running out of time.  In this first novel-length outing for Detective Shari Ansari, a serial-killer is on the loose, using the local park as a killing ground. With every passing day, the number of bodies hanging from the trees increases.   But when the victims are found to have something sinister in common, this bizarre case quickly transforms into a complex game of cat and mouse as Shari and her team hunt a clever vigilante who now has the community behind him.  At the same time, Shari must battle her own demons. Exhausted, out of her depth and unable to sleep, Shari descends into a cloud of self-doubt, unable to tell what is real and what isn&#39;t.  An enthusiastic journalist, a lazy partner, a powerful boss overseeing her every move... Shari needs help, and for DS Ryder to finally live up to his genius reputation." />
