  <title>Rosemary Cottage - Colleen Coble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Now a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;bestseller!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amy came to Rosemary Cottage to grieve, to heal, maybe even find love. But there&amp;rsquo;s a deadly undertow of secrets around Hope Island . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charming Rosemary Cottage on the beach offers Amy Lange respite she needs to mourn her brother, Ben. She&amp;rsquo;s even thinking of moving her midwife practice to the Outer Banks community. It&amp;rsquo;s always been a refuge for her and her family. She also wants to investigate Ben&amp;rsquo;s disappearance at sea. Everyone blames a surfing accident, but Amy has reason to wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coast Guard officer Curtis Ireland has lost a sibling too. His sister, Gina, was run down by a boat, leaving him to raise her infant daughter. If anyone knew who little Raine&amp;rsquo;s father was, Curtis could lose his beloved niece. Yet he can&amp;rsquo;t help being drawn to Hope Beach&amp;rsquo;s new midwife, Amy. He even agrees to help her investigate what happened to both Ben and Gina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can two grieving people with secrets find healing on beautiful Hope Island? Or will their quest for truth set them at odds with each other&amp;hellip;and with those who will go to any length to keep hidden things hidden?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Coble provides plenty of excitement for readers who enjoy her unique combination of cozy setting and action-packed mystery.&quot; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
