  <title>James&#39; Mother - Luke Luton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Beth, widowed after the untimely passing of her husband, cares for her shy son, James. The tragedy affected James deeply and he finds it hard to relate to young women his own age. He is often awkward, if not intimidated in sexual encounters. His mother worries about the lack of a father&amp;#39;s guiding hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
She knew where that was heading. Too many times her idle thoughts returned to her son. She&amp;#39;s pretty sure he peers through the keyhole of her bedroom, she would block the hole but doesn&amp;#39;t, teasing him if he&amp;#39;s there, never quite letting him see what he really wants to see. She knows he watches her around the house, in the car, a little too closely, hoping to steal a glimpse of thigh, watching her breasts, staring at any cleavage visible. She had caught him with erections filling his pants, wondering if she was the cause. Hoping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes when she made his bed when he left it unkempt, or, more likely, when she changed the sheets, she would find residue of semen that escaped whatever he tried to catch it in, sometimes she found her panties, she called them her cum catcher panties, left carelessly, discarded without thought when distracted by the next thought du&amp;#39;jour.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She would hold those panties stiff with his ejaculate, covering her nose and mouth, taking long breaths catching the scent of stale cum, taking the stiff parts into her mouth, softening them, sucking on them. Several times she had removed the panties she was wearing placing them where she found the cum soiled pair and pulled the soiled ones on, hoping the saliva moistened patch laid against her pussy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lying down where her son slept she would listen for sounds of movement in the house, assured she was alone she might use her fingers or vibrator, if the batteries were fresh and she remembered to bring it, on herself, toying, playing, arousing herself, trying to avoid those thoughts of her son but usually failing, feeling the warmth of her juices drain into the panties, pressing them to soak up her wetness, removing them, bunching them up, feeding them into her vagina, bringing herself to orgasm, laying there, on her sons bed, withdrawing the soaked clump of panties, leaving them where she found them for her son to rediscover, maybe realize with horror he had not put them away. She wondered if he knew or suspected what she had done to them?" />
