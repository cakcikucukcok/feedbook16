  <title>Lost and Found (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Jane Sigaloff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Her diary had never let her down, never told her it was too busy, never not been there for her. Unlike men!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now the unthinkable had happened….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For high-flying London lawyer (and self-confessed control freak) Sam Washington, accidentally leaving her diary in a New York hotel room is a fate worse than death! Tormented by the idea of a stranger reading her innermost thoughts, she knows there&#39;s also a secret in her little black book that, in the wrong hands, would devastate her best friend and cause a tabloid sensation….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alarm bells start ringing when TV producer Ben Fisher turns up on her doorstep–fresh off the plane from New York…and desperately seeking Sam. They&#39;re complete strangers, yet he seems to know more than a little about her: Has he found her diary? Has he read it? Sam resolves to find out by getting closer to Ben–who seems happy to oblige! Only, is his mind on kissing…or just telling?&lt;/p&gt;
