        &lt;h2&gt;Things are heating up…&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Sheikh&#39;s Rule&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His sister&#39;s life is at stake, and despite his wealth and power, Sheik Emir Al-Nassar feels helpless. At least heading his family&#39;s security agency provides him with resources to track down her kidnappers. But when the ace profiler he&#39;s sent turns out to be K. J. – Kate – Gelinsky, Emir is furious. Finding the kidnappers&#39; desert hideout is dangerous enough without the distraction of a beautiful woman.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Sheikh&#39;s Rescue&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Zafir Al-Nassar knows everything about Jade Van Everett. He’s studied the cases she’s worked for his family’s company and for the FBI. And it&#39;s hard not to notice that she’s absolutely gorgeous. Teaming up for a routine security detail, Jade is desperate to prove herself and Zafir can&#39;t help but admire her determination.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Son of the Sheikh&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Someone is threating to expose Sara Elliott’s secret. After draining her bank account, she flees to Morocco to face the one man she fears, the only man who can truly protect her son. Sheik Talib Al-Nassar has money and power beyond compare, but nothing could prepare him for seeing his ex, especially in his homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Sheikh Defence&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tossed overboard, Ava Adams had been left for dead, drifting at sea. But security specialist Faisal Al-Nassar was determined to find her. He owed her father a great debt and had never forgotten the connection he and Ava had once shared. Yet after rescuing Ava he discovered she barely remembered him.&lt;/p&gt;
