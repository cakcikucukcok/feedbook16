  <title>William Shakespeare Famous Works - William Shakespeare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 &amp;ndash; 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world&amp;#39;s greatest dramatist. &amp;nbsp;He is often called England&amp;#39;s national poet and the &amp;quot;Bard of Avon&amp;quot; (or simply &amp;quot;the Bard&amp;quot;). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.
