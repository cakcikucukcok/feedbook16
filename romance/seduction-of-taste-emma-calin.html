  <title>Seduction of Taste - Emma Calin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;TO HELP KEEP YOUR EREADER TOPPED UP, ALL TITLES IN THE SERIES ARE ON LOCKDOWN DURING CORONAVIRUS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hot Cops. Hot Crime. Hot Romance..... Hot Food?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Seduction of Taste&amp;rsquo; is the companion cookbook for the hot romance novel &amp;lsquo;Seduction of Dynasty&amp;rsquo;. It contains a total of thirty one illustrated recipes from appetizers and main courses to suggestions for sandwich fillings at a traditional afternoon tea. Late night suppers and romantic meals for two.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Food is the music of love. It sets the tone and the pace. It provides those moments when tastes and textures shared at the table form a metaphor for the physical appetites of love and lust.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As tough girl cop Shannon abandons herself to love with a sexy aristocrat. Many meals are shared. From the finest cuisine fit for royals, to the big power passion patrol fuel served in police canteens, &amp;lsquo;Seduction of Taste&amp;rsquo; gives you the recipes. You won&amp;#39;t want to put the novel down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With this cookbook you can tickle your taste buds as Emma Calin&amp;#39;s full on total Romance tickles your mind. If it touches the lovers&amp;#39; lips in the story, you can experience that moment with a meal cooked for your own special lover, be they a cool cucumber or a passionate pepper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read the romance, feel the passion, taste the love!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;??? Illustrations and detailed descriptions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Emma has cooked and photographed each dish with the same verve with which she writes. Take your recipes into the kitchen and follow&amp;nbsp;the instructions in a clear format.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;??? Easy to Navigate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each recipe is linked back to the table of contents so you can easily find your way to other recipes in the book - start with an appetizer, move on to a main course and finish with a dessert.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;??? Links and quotes from &amp;lsquo;Seduction of Dynasty&amp;rsquo;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each recipe is referenced to the chapter where it appears in the action romance novel - sometimes with a quotation from the text and often with additional comments from Emma Calin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
??? Be careful, the plates are hot!&lt;br /&gt;
