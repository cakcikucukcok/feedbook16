  <title>Sibling War - Cristina Monro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is about twin sisters named after Greek goddesses. Athena and Diana Bravo are both exceptionally intelligent, beautiful, and popular, but have nothing in common. They never got along with each other since birth, to the chagrin of their parents. The story, set in San Francisco, weaves around the separate lives of the fraternal twins, who are as different as night and day. It touches on the challenges they encounter in their respective jobs, their successes, and their relationships. From the very start, their individual lives are colored by betrayal, intrigue, and exciting connections. Their dialogues are replete with innuendoes and repartees.
Athena falls in love with Jonathan Prentiss, a dynamic lawyer who is also a main protagonist in the story, and Diana with Paolo Romano, a well-known chef. The animosity that exists between the twins results in countless conflicts, which lead to crime. Their paths cross unavoidably, and their lives become unbearably entangled till the end." />
