  <title>Elly: Cowgirl Bride - Trish Milburn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elly Cody, the only daughter of Wyoming&#39;s most powerful ranching family, set her sights on being a champion barrel racer long ago. Right about the time Will Jackson set his sights on Elly! Years away from Markton has dulled none of her appeal, and seeing the beautiful cowgirl again is like a one-two punch. He still wants her. Badly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tide has turned for Elly. Will the boy has turned into Will the &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#151;and now he&#39;s the one making her heart beat triple time. But why is he back in town? And what the heck is he doing working for her brother?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Elly finds out Will was hired to unearth a secret that&#39;s probably better off staying buried, she realizes it&#39;s time for a confrontation. Is he going to finish the job he&#39;s been hired to do? Or lose his chance with the only woman he&#39;s ever loved&amp;#133;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
