  <title>Full Blast - Janet Evanovich, Charlotte Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Turn up the heat and slip into something comfortable...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s never a dull moment for the residents of Beaumont, South Carolina. Lately, a heat wave&#39;s spiked the mercury--and everyone&#39;s sex drive. When newspaper owner Jamie Swift runs into millionaire playboy Max Holt, it&#39;s all she can do not to tear his clothes off--and the feeling is mutual. But trouble seems to follow Max like moths to a flame, and Jamie suspects he&#39;s all wrong for her. Meanwhile, the lingerie shop is having a sale on edible underwear, the bakery&#39;s selling aphrodisiac-laced brownies and x-rated birthday cakes, and even Jamie&#39;s dog is dodging passes from an amorous French poodle! But when someone starts bumping off some of the town&#39;s more annoying citizens, all clues lead straight to the new personals section in Jamie&#39;s newspaper. Pretty soon, things are getting hot and heavy, as Max and Jamie start uncovering secrets...and undressing each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fast-paced action, steamy sex, suspense, and lots of laughs--it&#39;s the &lt;i&gt;Full &lt;/i&gt;series from #1 bestselling author &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Janet Evanovich&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Bursting with action, adventure, and amusement.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;The Road to Romance&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Full Blast &lt;/i&gt;is the fourth book in the Full Series from Janet Evanovich and Charlotte Hughes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
