  <title>The Bet - Abigail Lucie</title>
      <meta name="description" content=":DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Kaley makes a bet with her twin brother Haley. She lost. He won, and gets sucked off by her right there on the school bus because of it. Now that she has the taste of his cream on his tongue, maybe she&amp;rsquo;s not so against her studly brother popping her cherry, too!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
His hand moved down my hip, bringing his cock well below its aim. I was very mindful of this knowing its true intent to notice the fingers stoking my clit until he shocking me with a couple of them brusquely going into my pussy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh shit!&amp;rdquo; I barely caught my breath.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I feared this tremble taking over my body. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if it was the feeling of having something new inside of me or if this was because he actually found something for me to shiver over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Uhhh!&amp;rdquo; I exasperated behind gritted teeth while I clamped my thighs together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That hurt?&amp;rdquo; Haley asked kindly, though his fingers were busy massaging that same place down there to let me know he already knew my answer. &amp;ldquo;Does that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shoved his fingers a couple of knuckles deep, keeping focus on the roof of my pussy looking for this spot he most certainly found. He brought his face up from my tit to attentively watch my face scrunch up and ride this feeling until water sprang from my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;God!&amp;rdquo; I cried out with my knocking knees bursting apart forcing me onto my back twisting my head insanely trying to find comfort in the lumpy bed beneath me. &amp;ldquo;No! No! No!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You want me to stop, Sis?&amp;rdquo; He asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you fucking dare!&amp;rdquo; I dinned." />
