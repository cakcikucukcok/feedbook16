      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kellan James is unwinding at Score when he spots the last person he&#39;d ever expect to find in his favorite bar. Sara Connelly--ER nurse, do-gooder, charitable crusader, and frequent pain in his ass. Both grew up privileged in swanky Southampton, but that&#39;s where the similarities end. Kellan&#39;s made it his mission to seek out life&#39;s pleasures; Sara gains pleasure from lecturing him on his lifestyle. Kellan would never date someone like her. Ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Kellan discovers Sara&#39;s been stood-up by an online date, something fierce and protective awakens inside of him. Typically, Kellan would enjoy teasing the jilted Sara, but something in her face sends him over to her table with a plan. He encourages her to take a walk on the wild side, one weekend of sin, no holds barred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She accepts, but it quickly becomes apparent that one night isn&#39;t enough. As the pull between them grows stronger, Kellan discovers it&#39;s a very dangerous thing to say never.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Pulse series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Engaging the Bachelor&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Seducing the Boss&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Claiming the Enemy&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Shocking the Medic&lt;/p&gt;" />
