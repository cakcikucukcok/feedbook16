  <title>The Parent Trap (Mills &amp; Boon Heartwarming) - Lee McKenzie</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;The trap is set… &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Single mom and successful boutique owner Sarah Stewart didn&#39;t have room in her life for a pet, let alone a man. With a teenage girl to raise and a business to run, she couldn&#39;t do anything more than &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; at Jonathan Marshall, the single–and singularly good-looking–man who just moved in next door with a teenage daughter of his own. Still, since their girls would be classmates, it made sense to make friends. But that was as far as it could go. Despite the best efforts of some teenage matchmaking, Sarah wasn&#39;t giving in. Because she just isn&#39;t ready to put her heart on the line–again.&lt;/p&gt;
