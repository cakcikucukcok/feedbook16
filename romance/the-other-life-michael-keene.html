  <title>‘The Other Life’ - Michael Keene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Heres another book to tantalize your imagination. 
Gino is a successful fashion photographer with a studio in London. The pressure of his success gets to him, so he decides to take time out to write his first book. He searches the internet for an ideal location where he can escape to and write. He settles for a log cabin nesting in the mountain range between France and Spain. On his arrival, he sets about setting up his laptop by a widow with a perfect view to inspire his writing. He begins to explore the wild area around the cabin. The sound of rushing water leads him to a lake. 
After a relaxing nude swim, he returns to the cabin. He was sure that he had closed the cabin door. Nervously, he enters only to find that his laptop had been opened up. On the screen was the start of a story. Who the hell could be responsible for this as he had not told anyone back home of his whereabouts? That night in bed, he is suddenly aware that he was not alone. Fear leads him to reach out across the bed in search of a person next to him and, to his relief, found nobody. 
The next morning, he finds that the story on his laptop has been added to. He reads it and, just for fun, adds his own words to the story. This routine continues for a couple of days, and Dino begins to enjoy the situation, but who is his coauthor? The days and nights pass until one night a vision appears at the foot of his bed dressed in sackcloth. The phantom is a handsome long-haired young man named Marco who assures Gino he is friendly. It appears that he had been killed two hundred years ago on the very spot where the cabin is situated and he returns annually. They continue to write the book together and on completion decide to go to London together to meet the publishers. Marco has no clothes and travels naked but not able to be seen for he is a ghost. They become lovers, and their lives are just full of hilarious situations where they live London life with the advantage of Marco being able to appear and disappear when required. A great advantage at times . . . but often creates tricky problems." />
