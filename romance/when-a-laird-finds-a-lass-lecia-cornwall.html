  <title>When a Laird Finds a Lass - Lecia Cornwall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;She is his greatest enemy and his only salvation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malcolm MacDonald, a lawyer in Edinburgh, unexpectedly inherits his father&#39;s title of Laird of Dunbronach, forcing him to return to a place he hasn&#39;t seen since he was a small child. To gain the trust of a wary clan, Malcolm must act upon their insistence that he cast aside his English betrothed and marry a Highlander. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they have one condition--no lasses of the barbaric clan MacLeod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he finds an unconscious woman in the sea, he brings her back to his clan but not before doing the one thing that could save her life--hiding her all too telling MacLeod plaid. When she wakes with no memory of who she is, Malcolm vows to keep the little he knows about her identity a secret. As new dangers threaten his clan, the mysterious lass teaches Malcolm some very important lessons about how to be a Highlander and a laird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But secrets never stay secret for long, and when she finds her plaid, her memory returns and she flees. Malcolm is forced to make a difficult choice to win her back, facing his darkest fears and his worst enemy for a chance at true love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
