  <title>A Promise Given - Samantha James, Sandra Kleinschmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Promise Given&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proud head of his Highland clan, Ian MacGregor has returned, cloaked in secrets, to the place where he spent many carefree years, in order to marry Margaret Kincaid--the lowlands lass to whom he has been betrothed since his youth. But it is the wild spirited and hauntingly beautiful Sabrina Kincaid who catches Ian&#39;s eye. And when Margaret mysteriously vanishes, he willingly accepts Sabrina as his bride in her sister&#39;s stead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Promise Kept&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dutybound to honor her father&#39;s wish, Sabrina reluctantly agrees to wed the rugged chieftain--though she fears the rumors of Ian&#39;s dark past. . .and the whispers that now blame him for Margaret&#39;s disappearance. But her sensuous soul bids her to pay no heed to her doubts and mistrust, and to submit instead to the searing passions that burn within her. For Ian&#39;s stirring yet tender caress speaks of a noble, gentle heart. And if peril is Sabrina&#39;s fate, so be it--for she is determined to learn the truths that will set them both free and carry them aloft together on the wings of incomparable love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
