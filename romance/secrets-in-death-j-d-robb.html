  <title>Secrets in Death - J. D. Robb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new novel in the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series: Lt. Eve Dallas must separate rumors from reality when a woman who traffics in other people&#39;s secrets is silenced.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chic Manhattan nightspot &lt;i&gt;Du Vin&lt;/i&gt; is not the kind of place Eve Dallas would usually patronize, and it&#39;s not the kind of bar where a lot of blood gets spilled. But that&#39;s exactly what happens one cold February evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mortally wounded woman is Larinda Mars, a self-described &quot;social information reporter,&quot; or as most people would call it, a professional gossip. As it turns out, she was keeping the most shocking stories quiet, for profitable use in her side business as a blackmailer. Setting her sights on rich, prominent marks, she&#39;d find out what they most wanted to keep hidden and then bleed them dry. Now someone&#39;s done the same to her, literally--with a knife to the brachial artery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eve didn&#39;t like Larinda Mars. But she likes murder even less. To find justice for this victim, she&#39;ll have to plunge into the dirty little secrets of all the people Larinda Mars victimized herself. But along the way, she may be exposed to some information she really didn&#39;t want to know...&lt;/p&gt;" />
