  <title>Sword of the Gods IV: The Dark Lord&#39;s Vessel - Anna Erishkigal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;At the dawn of time, two ancient adversaries battled for control of Earth. One man rose to stand at humanity&amp;#39;s side. A soldier whose name we still remember today...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Angelic Special Forces Colonel Mikhail Mannuki&amp;#39;ili has suffered from dissociative amnesia ever since his species was slaughtered as a child. The Cherubim said he must never try to remember the Seraphim Genocide. Whenever he tries, he blacks out and lots of people end up dead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But old ghosts refuse to remain buried. With the village destroyed and whispers the white-winged Angelic is his own Prime Minister, each night, his dead &lt;i&gt;ch&amp;eacute;ad ph&amp;oacute;sadh &lt;/i&gt;visits his nightmares to warn him about the lizard at the door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Abaddon closes in on Earth, Lucifer deals with the fallout from his recent possession, Gita tries to clear her name, and Ba&amp;#39;al Zebub rallies a new threat against Assur, Mikhail must find a way to rescue his pregnant wife without succumbing to the terrifying power he can wield, but not control.&lt;br /&gt;
