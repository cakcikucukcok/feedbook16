  <title>Surface Paradise - Allan Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the day he was born, Michael Sykes has had every whim indulged. A child of privilege, luxury, and unfulfilled expectations, he is a man driven to lovewith varying degrees of success and failure. The unconditional mothering love of his widowed mother has set him up for seemingly impossible relationships with women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia, Michael works for the American Legation in Sydney and woos Anne, his &lt;i&gt;femme fatale&lt;/i&gt;, yet eventually he will marry Gloria, but Anne will always remain for him a part of the unattainable brightness of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael and Anne, after the consummation of their relationship, join his best friend, Ralph (Glorias brother), in his sailboat and they are lost in a hurricane with Michael as the sole survivor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling desolate, Michael makes a slow recovery in hospital, but after studying for a year in Europe, he returns to Australia and marries Gloria, entering the brokerage business founded by his father. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this young man be healed and live up to the high expectations that his mother has held for him, or must he be forever condemned by a broken heart at the loss of Anne?&lt;/p&gt;" />
