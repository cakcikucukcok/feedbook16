  <title>Miss Charlotte Surrenders - Cathy Gillen Thacker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A fan-favorite story from bestselling Harlequin American Romance author Cathy Gillen Thacker!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She Was a Lady…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Charlotte Langston needs to focus on saving her family&#39;s languishing estate. The once-gorgeous plantation is facing foreclosure unless Charlotte can earn money for the next payment. What she doesn&#39;t need is the distraction of Brett Forrest, her sexy new caretaker, who is doing his best to make her forget her Southern manners!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But He Was No Gentleman!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brett isn&#39;t who he says he is, but hiding right under Charlotte&#39;s nose seems like the perfect deception. The Southern belle could easily earn the money she needs by exposing him as the reclusive writer of a series of popular novels. But it&#39;s much more fun to tempt her with hot kisses and feed the sparks that fly between them! What will happen, though, when the independent Charlotte finds out he&#39;s about to buy the place from under her?&lt;/p&gt;
