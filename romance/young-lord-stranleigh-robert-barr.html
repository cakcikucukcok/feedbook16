  <title>Young Lord Stranleigh - Robert Barr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you have interest in finance, mining and sailing which is largely centered around those 3 topics in this novel, you are welcome! „Young Lord Stranleigh” is a thrilling tale of romance and suspense by Robert Barr. Some very sharp City of London operators think that rich Lord Stranleigh, a Bertie Woosterish West End fashion plate, is an easy mark to make some money. There is a potential gold mine in Africa, for example; a dilapidated but workable cargo steamer The Rajah, to haul the gold ore back to England. What more is needed? An entertaining yarn of dealing, double dealing and even triple dealing, and young Lord Stranleigh is by no means as big a mug as he looks. Suspenseful and full of character, this tale is a must for Barr fans." />
