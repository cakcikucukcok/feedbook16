  <title>Play Me to Infinity - Carey Decevito, Karen Hrdlicka, Eric David Battershell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all about misconceptions...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burned by his ex-fianc&amp;eacute;e, Mike Withers traded in his dream of a family and home of his own, complete with the white picket fence, and submersed himself in work. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; entertaining the occasional lady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when he relocated to Jacksonville to take over as CEO of Withers International, and be closer to his sister&amp;rsquo;s family, he never imagined he&amp;#39;d find himself at a crossroads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a player, always a player, right?

Ultimately, the choice is his to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe his ex wasn&amp;#39;t the one? Maybe he&amp;#39;d given up too soon? And maybe happiness lay in the form of a feisty, argumentative, tiny package in a tight skirt - with the ability to turn any argument into foreplay?&lt;/p&gt;" />
