          &lt;strong&gt;A Mistletoe Marriage? &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;What could be nicer than a Christmas wedding?&quot; Under normal circumstances Amber would have agreed with the sentiment but Max Warner was only offering her a cold-blooded marriage of convenience, designed solely to give their daughter a name. He didn&#39;t love her - had never loved her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Eight years before, he had walked out of her life, not even knowing that their torrid affair had left more than heartache in its wake. And yet the thought of being Max&#39;s bride was proving irresistible, even if it meant that the only Christmas present Amber ended up with was another broken heart!&lt;/p&gt;
