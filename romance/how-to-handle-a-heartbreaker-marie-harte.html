  <title>How to Handle a Heartbreaker - Marie Harte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;Two broken hearts search of their happy ending in this hot and spicy contemporary romance from a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A romance writer, Abby knows a heartbreaker when she sees one. But Brody is determined to make sure their real-life love story gets her the happily-ever-after she deserves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s lust at first sight when &lt;b&gt;Brody Singer&lt;/b&gt; first lays eyes on &lt;b&gt;Abby Dunn&lt;/b&gt;. The dark-haired beauty looks a lot like a woman he once knew, who died years ago. At first, Brody fears his attraction is a holdover from that secret crush, but Abby&#39;s definitely different. She&#39;s a lot shyer, a lot sexier, and despite her attempts to dissuade his interest, absolutely mesmerizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby isn&#39;t having any of it. She&#39;s still trying to put her last disastrous relationship behind her and overcome the flaws her ex wouldn&#39;t let her forget. But somehow Brody isn&#39;t getting the hint. It doesn&#39;t help that when writing her steamy novels, she keeps casting Brody at the hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brody is more than happy to serve as her muse and eager to help make sure her &quot;research&quot; is authentic. But when their research turns into something real...&lt;b&gt;will she choose her own happily ever after&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A wonderful blend of humor and heat&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;How to Handle a Heartbreaker&lt;/i&gt; is a refreshing sexy contemporary romance.
