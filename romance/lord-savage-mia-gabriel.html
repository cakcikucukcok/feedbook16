  <title>Lord Savage - Mia Gabriel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&#39;d never felt so vulnerable, at once both lost and found, as I now did sprawled half-naked across Savage in this foolish throne-chair. His strength was my solace, my comfort, and there was nothing better than hearing the beating of his heart beneath my ear. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Once trapped in a loveless, pleasure-less marriage, Evelyn Hart leaves her home in New York for the glittering ballrooms of 1907 London. When she arrives, she meets the Earl of Savage, a dark, powerful man who seems to live up to his name. Despite his noble trappings, he&#39;s also a man who can possess her with just one look. Soon Evelyn finds herself pulled into Savage&#39;s world - a world of passion and seductive games unlike any she has ever experienced. Evelyn&#39;s heart is captured with no hope of escape. But can they overcome the tortures of the past together...?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savage never imagined someone like Evelyn walking into his life. As soon as he sees her he knows he &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; have her, no matter the cost, in &lt;i&gt;Lord Savage &lt;/i&gt;by Mia Gabriel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
