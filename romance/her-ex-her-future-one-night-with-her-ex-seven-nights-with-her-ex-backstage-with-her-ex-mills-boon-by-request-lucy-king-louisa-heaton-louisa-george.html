  <title>Her Ex, Her Future?: One Night with Her Ex / Seven Nights with Her Ex / Backstage with Her Ex (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Lucy King, Louisa Heaton, Louisa George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Her Ex, Her Future?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Night with Her Ex by Lucy King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily Montgomery knows how to have the perfect New Year’s Eve: a hot, one-night stand with a sexy millionaire. Trouble is, the man in question is Kit – the ex-husband she’s spent five years getting over. Soon though these two will find it hard to say goodbye…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seven Nights with Her Ex by Louisa Heaton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For neurologist Beau Judd, a medical course is her chance to escape. But her trip half-way around the world only brings her closer to the man who left her at the altar, Dr Gray McGregor! Now, as they head into the wild, he realises he made a mistake. Can he win back the woman he loves in seven days?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstage with Her Ex by Louisa George&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiding out in the gents’ toilets backstage is not the way Sasha imagined bumping into her ex. Especially when that ex is famously wild rock god Nate Munro! She has a massive favour to ask him, but one glimpse of his sinfully dark eyes and all she can think about is that he’s seen her naked!&lt;/p&gt;
