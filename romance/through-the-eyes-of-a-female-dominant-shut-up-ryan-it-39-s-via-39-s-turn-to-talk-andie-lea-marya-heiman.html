  <title>Through the Eyes of a Female Dominant: Shut Up, Ryan! It&#39;s Via&#39;s Turn to Talk... - Andie Lea, Marya Heiman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Via is a strong woman who doesn&#39;t take crap from anyone, not even her own husband!  The newly married couple, Ryan and Olivia Rayner, settle into their lives together and are thrown into an emotional whirlwind that pushes Ryan into seeking outside help from an old friend. As Via and Ryan embark on their new adventure, retired actors Ryan and Melanie Carlisle (Secrets Revealed) enter their lives in the most unexpected way. The Carlisle&#39;s have been forced out of retirement and the Rayner&#39;s are just the ticket they need to teach them how to be Dom/Sub. Ryan &amp; Via must prove that their marriage is more than just pleasure for the sadistic.  As the Carlisle&#39;s begin to accept them as normal, someone from both of the couple&#39;s past has made an unpleasant return. Via and Melanie are then forced to work together in order to save their husband&#39;s lives.   After this major scare of almost losing her husband, there couldn&#39;t possibly be more drama in their lives. Could there?   Shortly after saving her husband&#39;s ass, Via soon unravels a secret she never suspected Ryan would carry. A secret so wet and juicy that it will leave you so...well...wet and juicy! Will Ryan&#39;s exposed secret be the beginning to the end of his marriage?  Set through the eyes of Via, readers will enjoy every moment. They will laugh, cry, and fall in love with the dynamic duo. Via &amp; Ryan&#39;s story is guaranteed to be full of surprises that will fill the hearts of readers.   Did I mention the sex scenes are so hot, they could melt the ink off of the pages of Fifty Shades?!" />
