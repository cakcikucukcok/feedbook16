  <title>Destiny in Wild Africa - Jean Mary Bonsor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Destiny in Wild Africa
by
Jean Mary Bonsor
To get over a break up with her boyfriend, Suzanna Scott reluctantly agrees to accompany her cousin Sally on a week&#39;s holiday to a remote bush camp in the Zambezi Valley.
She is unprepared for the beauty of the camp and, despite her initial resistance, discovers deep in her heart an awakening love and compassion for the rugged bushveld and the animals that live within it&#39;s fascinating confines. 
One person keeps upsetting her, though. The brusque and intolerant manager of the camp seems intent on clashing swords with Suzanna. Why can&#39;t she just walk away and ignore his unsettling influence? How can she possibly know that their destinies are linked together? A die cast without their knowledge.
This is a charming story that takes the reader deep into the wilds of northern Zimbabwe  an area that many people can only dream of visiting - and leaves them with a warm and memorable glow of satisfaction." />
