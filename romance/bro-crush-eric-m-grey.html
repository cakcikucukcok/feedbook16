  <title>Bro Crush - Eric M. Grey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Nerdy Nate and his big jock brother Ethan have always gotten along better than most brothers. But it&amp;#39;s still a surprise when Ethan comes to visit Nate at college. Sparks fly as Nate&amp;#39;s hero worship combines with Ethan&amp;#39;s indiscriminate sex drive, especially when Ethan decides that Nate needs some manscaping. Nate never expected that his bro crush would lead to one intimate and very hot weekend visit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I sat crosslegged on the couch and he sprawled in the recliner facing me, his crotch spread wide. I could see everything. He still had a semi going.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well, you at least aren&amp;#39;t hairy,&amp;quot; I joked, pointing to his shaved balls. &amp;quot;Isn&amp;#39;t it a pain to keep that like that?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He tugged on his balls, looking down. &amp;quot;What, shaved?&amp;quot; He fingered them a little. &amp;quot;Sometimes. They&amp;#39;re due for another go. But it feels awesome. Ever try it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My face must have been beet red. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe I was talking about my brother&amp;#39;s balls. &amp;quot;Naw, man, I&amp;#39;m cool.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No seriously. It feels really sick. Here, see.&amp;quot; He stood up and stood in front of me, his hips thrust forward, his dick bobbing only a few inches from my face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dude. I&amp;#39;m not feeling up your balls.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He grabbed my hand and held it to his crotch. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not asking you to have sex, asshole, just give a feel.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His balls were in my palm. I could feel the slight stubble, raspy against my skin. They were slightly damp with sweat, and surprisingly cool to the touch. His balls must have been at least twice the size of mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I pulled my hand away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Isn&amp;#39;t it sick? I love it.&amp;quot; He rubbed his balls between both his hands, and his dick jumped a little. &amp;quot;And chicks love it too. Remember Catrina? She told me she literally couldn&amp;#39;t lick other guys&amp;#39; balls but she loved licking mine.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ethan&amp;#39;s semi was rising. My cock was beginning to thicken too. I tried to look away but I couldn&amp;#39;t, as he palmed his balls right in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dude,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;Jesus. Seriously. My roommates&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He looked up. He grinned. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right. We should take this to the bedroom.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This? What was &amp;quot;this&amp;quot;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He offered a hand to hoist me to my feet, and I wordlessly complied. My heart was racing. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure what he had in mind. But I didn&amp;#39;t really have any power to say no.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He held onto my hand as he tugged me into the bedroom. I kicked the door shut. No way in hell did I want my roommates seeing this. Whatever &amp;quot;this&amp;quot; was.&lt;br /&gt;
