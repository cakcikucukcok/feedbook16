  <title>Deceived - Mary Balogh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seven years ago, Christopher Atwell, newly and happily married to Lady Elizabeth Ward, was framed for several misdemeanors. When no one, even his wife, would believe his protestations of innocence, he fled to Canada, while Elizabeth&#39;s powerful father arranged for a divorce. But now Christopher has inherited an earldom upon the death of his own father and has returned to England to take up his responsibilities—and prove his innocence. The first thing he learns upon his arrival in London, however, is that Elizabeth is to marry another man the next day in a grand ton wedding. Christopher has no reason to care about the woman who had so little faith in him seven years ago. He can ignore the impending event and proceed on his way home to his estate. Or…he can do something to stop the wedding. But what? And why?" />
