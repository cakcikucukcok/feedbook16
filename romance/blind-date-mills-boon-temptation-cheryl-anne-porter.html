  <title>Blind Date (Mills &amp; Boon Temptation) - CHERYL ANNE PORTER</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The first time Joe Rossi met Meg Kendall, they were both half-naked in the men&#39;s fitting rooms. She&#39;d been mortified…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and he&#39;d been turned on. He figures his chances of running into her again are nil…until he learns &lt;em&gt;she&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; the blind date his uncle has set up for him. Here is his chance to get to know her better. And this time Joe hopes they&#39;ll end up &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; naked together.…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meg can&#39;t believe her blind date is the gorgeous guy from the mall. How embarrassing! And yet, sort of thrilling, too! Meg has never been the daring type, but she&#39;s ready to turn over a new leaf. And when her date with Joe turns into a wild night of excitement and danger, Meg discovers a craving for adventure she hadn&#39;t known she possessed. And before long, she&#39;s ready to satisfy her craving for Joe, too.…&lt;/p&gt;
