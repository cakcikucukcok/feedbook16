They returned as men, was-weary and with heavy hearts, yet determined to find love and rebuild their lives in the crumbled ruins of the South. these are their stories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment Hamilton Dodge set eyes on Southern beauty Starla Fairfax, the sparks flew. She was flirtatious, frivolous. . .everything that he was not. And yet he couldn&#39;t get her out of his mind. So he asked her to marry, never dreaming she&#39;d say yes. After all, he was a Yankee who&#39;d come to Pride County to rebuild his life, and she was one of the town&#39;s leading belles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Hamilton didn&#39;t fool himself--Starla agreed to be his wife in name only because she needed a strong man to protect her honor. Yet as their cool agreement gave way to the fires of passion, Hamilton realized he&#39;d never rest until Starla became his wife--in every way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
