  <title>When the Night Whispers - Savanna Welles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A riveting, modern-day gothic tale about a woman who succumbs and then must save herself from a dark lover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That night was the first time I tasted champagne--French he told me, and as I loved all things French I was enchanted. I barely remember what we said--only that I did most of the talking: about leaving the South, my dreams of becoming a writer, my thoughts of Harlem . . . and of you. He said very little, only this: &quot;The moment I saw you I knew you would be mine forever. And even death, even that, could not part us.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;Jocelyn&#39;s life feels empty, devoid of passion and purpose. After she finds a journal written by her &quot;doomed&quot; great-grandmother, Caprice, she is spellbound by her story: the escape from a loveless marriage, her seduction by a nameless lover who is both &quot;demon and savior.&quot; Then, as if stepping out of a dream, Jocelyn meets Asa, her mysterious next door neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asa is charming, handsome, and daring and, as if by magic, she is drawn into his hedonistic lifestyle. Yet there is something unsettling about Asa. Luna is suspicious of this man, and although Jocelyn is dismissive of Luna and amused by her friend&#39;s warnings, she can&#39;t completely ignore them. She begins to wonder if things with Asa aren&#39;t quite what they seem.&lt;/p&gt;" />
