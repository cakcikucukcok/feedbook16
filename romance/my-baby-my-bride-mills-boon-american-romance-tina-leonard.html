  <title>My Baby, My Bride (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) - Tina Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Liberty Wentworth may have abandoned Duke Forrester on their wedding day, but when she returns to Tulips, Texas, pregnant with his child, Duke knows he&#39;ll do anything to win her back. But how? Liberty&#39;s claiming he&#39;s as ornery as ever, and she can&#39;t live with a bullheaded man like him for the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So Duke takes some advice from an unlikely source–the ladies of the Tulips Saloon. These women have brought him much pain with their meddling, but if he&#39;s ever going to marry the woman he loves, he&#39;ll have to follow their &quot;recipe&quot; for success. Because no matter what it takes, Duke is going to spend his life with Liberty–even if that means softening up around the edges. After all, a man has to do what a man has to do!&lt;/p&gt;
