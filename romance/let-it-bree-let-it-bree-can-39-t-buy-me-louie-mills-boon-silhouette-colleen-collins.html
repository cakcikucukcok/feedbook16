        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a hard day&#39;s night on the lam!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let It Bree &lt;/strong&gt;by Colleen Collins&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kirk Dunmore has suddenly found himself in times of trouble! When he stops to help a stranded Bree Brown, he winds up being chased by bad guys who are after Bree&#39;s pet &lt;em&gt;bull?!&lt;/em&gt; And while they&#39;ve been making their evasive maneuvers, he&#39;s managed to fall in love with Bree. So now he has to find the words of wisdom to convince her there&#39;s plenty of room for her–and her &lt;em&gt;pet–in&lt;/em&gt; his life.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can&#39;t Buy Me Louie &lt;/strong&gt;by Colleen Collins&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Former bad guy Louie Ragazzi is dark, sexy and a little dangerous–and Alicia Hansen is just a little in love. She&#39;s determined to &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; him get over his &quot;I&#39;m a one-man show&quot; thing. Shouldn&#39;t take much because, well, look at her! She&#39;s got it all, including the cash. Louie doesn&#39;t seem to care too much for the money, but after spending a few steamy days with her while they outrun his past, he does seem to be considering a partnership….&lt;/p&gt;
