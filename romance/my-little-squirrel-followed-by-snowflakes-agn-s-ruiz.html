  <title>My Little Squirrel Followed By Snowflakes - Agnès Ruiz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A man and a woman pass each other in the metro every day. They study each other and obviously both like what they see... Should they take things further? Who will make the first move?
Benjamin has passed his lawyer’s exams with flying colours and practises in a prestigious law firm. Everything should be going well for him. Except that his mother left home when he was ten years old. Why does he still have this constant sense of unease after all these years without her?&lt;br/&gt;
Agnès Ruiz is the author of several best-sellers. She had huge success with her first novel “Ma vie assassinée”. She writes for both adults and children. Her short stories featuring the investigations of detective Rachel Toury have also been very successful in Europe as well as North America. Several translations are available. She is originally from Normandy (France) and lived in Canada for almost 20 years.&lt;br/&gt;" />
