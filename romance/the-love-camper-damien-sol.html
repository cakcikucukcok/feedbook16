      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
The Coldbart family hide a secret from the youngest son. Until he was of age to partake in the bountifulness of the luscious female members in his family. On a trip to the one place where Eddy could perv out sneaking peeks at his mother and two sisters. The Coldbart family is met with an odd twist of fate as their once nudist getaway had now been turned into the newest branch of Camp Bare Rump.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Remember you can&amp;rsquo;t say a word, no matter how good it feels,&amp;rdquo; Laurel said, her hands run up and down his chest as she straddled his legs. &amp;ldquo;And baby, I so hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy being inside of your mother&amp;rsquo;s pussy, because you don&amp;rsquo;t know how long I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to fuck you,&amp;rdquo; she said, with a coy smile as her son mouthed the word &amp;ldquo;What?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s right,&amp;rdquo; Laurel said, nodding her head. &amp;ldquo;I bet you thought you were the only one that had a thing for your family members. How does it feel to know you aren&amp;rsquo;t as twisted as you thought you were as you gazed so lewd at me and your sisters?&amp;rdquo; she asked, her eyes sparkling at his broad smile. &amp;ldquo;Can you feel how wet your mother&amp;rsquo;s pussy is just wanting to fuck this cock, baby?&amp;rdquo; Laurel asked, her left hand bracing herself on the ceiling as she ran her son&amp;rsquo;s rod through her saturated lips. Chuckling as Eddy&amp;rsquo;s hands flew to his mouth to keep anyone from hearing his moan as she rubbed her sex against his oversensitive cock. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll take that to mean you love how your mother&amp;rsquo;s pussy feels,&amp;rdquo; she said, her heart fluttering as Eddy nodded. &amp;ldquo;Good boy, you should love how the pussy that gave birth to you feels. Now I don&amp;rsquo;t expect you to last for a long time, just hold out until your mother can cum, okay?&amp;rdquo; Laurel said, rising on her knees. Positioning the head of his rod at her entrance. &amp;ldquo;Are you ready baby?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;For you Mom, always,&amp;rdquo; Eddy said, in a very low whisper before his hands clamped around his mouth once again. Laurel felt her whole body heat. Her tan skin becoming flushed as watched how her son gazed at her. The love she saw in his blue eyes. That&amp;rsquo;s how it should always be between lovers." />
