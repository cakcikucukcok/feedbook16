        &lt;p&gt;Top surgeon Mitch is a catch. Just not for Jacqui, who wants a place to belong. Sexy workaholics like Mitch have never been her type. But then they become temporary housemates…and the spark between them blazes into an inferno. Mitch isn’t looking to settle down.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until he becomes captivated by the intriguing beauty who keeps his sister’s house running. He knows Jacqui’s attracted to him. So why’s she keeping him at arm’s length? Mitch will have to use his most persuasive bedside manner to convince her that home is wherever she is.&lt;/p&gt;
