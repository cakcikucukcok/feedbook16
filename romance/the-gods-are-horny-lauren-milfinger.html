  <title>The Gods are Horny - Lauren Milfinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
The gods of ancient Moronia were a lecherous, incestuous lot, worshiped with screwing and blowjobs in the temple, and fond of using the &amp;quot;sacred orb&amp;quot; to watch mortals having sex. Between having sex with her brother, writing dirty stories, and eating out her younger friend, Lauren Milfinger has taken a fascinating, sexy, and frequently funny look at Moronite culture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
After discovering that ugly humans seemed just as, or possibly more, interested in fucking than attractive ones, Oroyna finally found a couple who were both esthetically pleasing, and wonderfully creative. The man was tall, muscular, and handsome. Oroyna guessed he was no more than eighteen or nineteen. The woman was older, shapely, beautiful, and had fiery red hair. Just then, she was kneeling in front of the man, with his cock in her mouth. As her head moved slowly in and out, Oroyna lifted his own cock in his hand and began to stroke it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was naked, of course. It seemed that people had invented clothing, but the gods hadn&amp;rsquo;t bothered. They had perfect bodies, and were completely indifferent to the weather. Born in the chill vacuum of the Nothing, as Kolek had been, the gods existed slightly outside of time and space even when they came down to earth. Hot or cold, they were comfortable anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The woman in the sacred orb&amp;rsquo;s image continued to suck the man&amp;rsquo;s cock. At the same time, she was working a finger in and out of her pussy. Oroyna had his cock hard now, and was stroking it rapidly. It felt good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Just what are you up to?&amp;rdquo; Nalima asked, entering the throne room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I was finished with all the building,&amp;rdquo; Oroyna answered, without pausing his jerking. &amp;ldquo;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do something to entertain myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nalima nodded. &amp;ldquo;I can see that.&amp;rdquo; She looked at the image in the sacred orb. The woman&amp;rsquo;s head was moving faster now, and her fingers were almost a blur as she worked them against her clit and plunged them into her cunt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The woman was moaning softly. Nalima was sure she was cumming, and wondered if she would fuck the man, or let him cum in her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Who are they?&amp;rdquo; Nalima asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oroyna didn&amp;rsquo;t interrupt his stroking, but did ask the sacred orb to identify the couple. &amp;ldquo;Someone named Elihammur and, ah, his mother, Zara.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Did Mom ever do that for you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oroyna shook his head. &amp;ldquo;She didn&amp;rsquo;t hang around long enough,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Can I try?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nalima knelt in front of the throne and pushed her brother&amp;rsquo;s knees further apart. Reaching out, she wrapped the fingers of her right hand around his massive shaft, stroking it, but more slowly than he had done. A clear bead of pre-cum glistened at the tip.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She leaned forward and licked the pre-cum from Oroyna&amp;rsquo;s cockhead. She found that she liked the taste. Her lips parted, sliding down to engulf the fat, purple knob. Her tongue swirled around it as she took his cock deeper into her eager mouth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is nice, Nalima thought. We should have started doing this much sooner." />
