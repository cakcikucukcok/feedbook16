      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eden&lt;/i&gt;: Josh Evans and I have been best friends forever. He knows all my secrets, and I know all of his. So when he randomly asks me to help him lose his virginity, I sort of flip out. That&#39;s a question that sends your mind to places you&#39;ve seriously never considered before. Like, you know. Having sex. With your best friend. Except Josh doesn&#39;t want to have sex with me--he wants me to help him find a girl. A nice girl who&#39;s funny and smart and cute. Except he already knows a girl just like that...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Josh&lt;/i&gt;: Eden Sumner is my best friend. So of course she&#39;d be the person to help me find my perfect match, so I can drop my V card before I head off to college. Except the more we search, the more I realize that maybe the right girl has been by my side all along. I don&#39;t need Eden&#39;s help in finding me a girl to love. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m already in love with Eden. But now she thinks I&#39;m only after one thing...with anyone &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book is what happens when American Pie meets Friends with Benefits. It contains two best friends, plenty of angst, and lots and lots of sex talk. Reading this might have you looking at your best friend in a different light!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
