  <title>Never Trust a Pirate - Valerie Bowman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bestselling author Valerie Bowman sets the stage in Regency England for her Playful Brides series, where couples&#39; misadventures on the way to the altar are witty, romantic romps based on some of the world&#39;s most beloved plays. The seventh book in the series, &lt;i&gt;Never Trust a Pirate&lt;/i&gt;, is inspired by Emma Orczy&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Pimpernel&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The rules of engagement were never so scandalous. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rumored pirate and the scurrilous black sheep of his well-to- do family, Cade Cavendish relishes his world of rebellion, deception, and seduction. Nothing and no one can hold him to be the duty-bound, honorable man he is expected to be. But when an unexpected run-in at his twin brother&#39;s estate with a ravishing, raven-haired maid leads her to believe he&#39;s actually a viscount, Cade&#39;s renegade life is thrown wildly off-kilter. And even though a case of mistaken identity can be quickly set to rights, matters of the heart are quite different...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miss Danielle LaCrosse is startled to learn that the handsome gentleman who radiates sin and has the devil in his eyes is not her employer the Viscount, but rather his infamous brother. A former heiress, orphaned and left penniless, Danielle has more than a few secrets of her own. Cade may be skilled at coaxing even the most hidden desires out of Danielle but can he earn her trust--and win her heart--as they embark on an adventure to confront a dangerous enemy from both of their pasts . . . and uncover the identity of the so-called Black Fox along the way?&lt;/p&gt;" />
