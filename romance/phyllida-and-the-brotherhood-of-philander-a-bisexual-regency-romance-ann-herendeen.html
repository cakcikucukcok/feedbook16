  <title>Phyllida and the Brotherhood of Philander: A Bisexual Regency Romance - Ann Herendeen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The meddling mothers of the Regency would do anything to wed their daughters to Andrew Carrington, the wealthy, handsome, and athletic heir to an earldom. There is one problem, however. No woman in all England would suit the determined bachelor, for Andrew far prefers the company of men&amp;#8212;at his table and in his bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with privilege comes responsibility. Andrew must take a bride. And while Phyllida Lewis, the penniless, spirited, and curvaceous author of romantic novels, is not quite what his family had in mind, a marriage to her would enable Andrew to live his life as he pleases. The arrival of Matthew Thornby, the honorable and dashing son of a self-made baronet, into their cozy arrangement makes Andrew&#39;s happiness complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet a shrewd enemy is waiting in the wings, threatening to expose them all&amp;#8212;an act that will surely lead to scandal and ruin.&lt;/p&gt;" />
