          &lt;strong&gt;The Historical 2014 Collection&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;6 incredible historical romances that feature aristocrats, highwaymen, cowboys, delectable rebels, rakes and rogues. Step back in time with these Mills &amp; Boon Historical authors to experience their world…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fall of a Saint&lt;/strong&gt; by Christine Merrill&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ONLY WOMAN WHO CAN MAKE HIM REPENT!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honourable—and handsome to boot!—Michael Poole, Duke of St. Aldric, has earned his nickname &quot;The Saint.&quot; But the ton would shudder if they knew the truth. Because, thrust into a world of debauchery, this saint has turned sinner!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the Highwayman&#39;s Pleasure&lt;/strong&gt; by Sarah Mallory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAPTIVATED BY THE DARK RIDER…&lt;/strong&gt;Embittered by injustice, Ross Durden leads a double life: gentleman farmer by day, roguish highwayman by night. He has sworn to right the wrongs of the past, but danger lurks around every corner—not least when he sets eyes on the beautiful daughter of his sworn enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mishap Marriage &lt;/strong&gt;by Helen Dickson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST COMES DECEPTION…THEN COMES MARRIAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Captain Zack Fitzgerald sails into Santamaria with his rugged, dangerous appeal, for Shona McKenzie he’s a ticket to freedom. And then her sister-in-law’s scheming places them in a highly compromising situation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secrets at Court &lt;/strong&gt;by Blythe Gifford&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE THRONE OF ENGLAND IS AT STAKE!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne of Stamford has long been the keeper of her mistress&#39;s secrets, but when Lady Joan marries the king’s son, court life becomes ever more perilous. Sir Nicholas Lovayne has arrived to uncover the truth about Lady Joan’s past, and Anne must do something—anything—to throw him off….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rebel Captain&#39;s Royalist Bride &lt;/strong&gt;by Anne Herries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOVE THINE ENEMY… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orphaned and without protection, Babette Harvey must suffer in silence when her uncle gives shelter to a band of Rebels—though her Royalist blood boils! But other dangerous passions must also be quieted—including those aroused by the handsome and commanding Rebel leader Captain James Colby.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cowboy&#39;s Reluctant Bride&lt;/strong&gt; by Debra Cowan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE…&lt;/strong&gt;If there’s one thing Ivy Powell hates it’s accepting help! But after receiving menacing threats she’s left with no choice but to make a proposition to a ruggedly handsome cowboy. The only problem is Ivy’s first marriage destroyed her trust in men, and walking down the aisle again isn’t something she’ll undertake lightly….&lt;/p&gt;
