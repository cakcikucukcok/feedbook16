  <title>Spy Play - Kt Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Toni Tribiani lives in the French Quarter of New Orleans, and runs a Private Investigation company, that is known for busting cheating spouses. She is adapt in various forms of martial arts and is proficient with weapons.&amp;nbsp; In her business you have&amp;nbsp;to be prepared. She is&amp;nbsp;just about to find out she will&amp;nbsp;once again have to use her skills to save her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the smoky bar area of a restaurant, a man was watching her. Even through all of the haze, and the dim lighting he thought she was the most gorgeous woman in the world. Although some of her friends were quite pretty, he couldn&amp;#39;t take his eyes off of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh God, she was sexy. Hot. Powerful. Dangerous. She could very well end up being the death of him. Hell, she might even be the one to kill him.&amp;nbsp; But - hey, everyone had to die sometime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He looked around the place taking in the amount of people there, and making note of the exits. Tipping the friendly young&amp;nbsp;bartender he moved to a booth in the corner that was in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning his attention back to Toni, he realized he could actually see all of them better from here.&amp;nbsp; In his musings, he almost missed the two thugs who&amp;nbsp;walked in the door. The fact that they had jackets on wasn&amp;#39;t a good sign, because it was quite warm outside, but even he was surprised at how quickly one of them pulled out his gun and shot the bartender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Damn it. The kid never had a chance. The question was, were the goons here looking for Toni, someone in her group, or were they there looking for him? A Spy could never be too sure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
