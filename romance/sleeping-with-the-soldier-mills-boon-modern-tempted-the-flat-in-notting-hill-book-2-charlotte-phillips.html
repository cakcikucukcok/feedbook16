  <title>Sleeping with the Soldier (Mills &amp; Boon Modern Tempted) (The Flat in Notting Hill, Book 2) - Charlotte Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A sleepless night too many!&lt;br /&gt;All Lara Connor knows about the hot-as-sin guy who lives above her is that his nocturnal activities are keeping her awake. A lot. Fed up – and not at all jealous! – she decides to confront the man head-on. Big mistake! Because, face to face, Lara sees just why so many women fall into Alex’s bed!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nights have been sheer torture for ex-soldier Alex ever since he returned from active duty, but he’s not about to share that with Lara. But, when she becomes his unexpected flatmate, temptation personified is sleeping in the room next door and keeping his distance is going to be difficult. Impossible. In fact… it’s the perfect opportunity to show her just why sleep is so overrated…&lt;br /&gt;The Flat in Notting Hill - Love and lust in the city that never sleeps!&lt;/p&gt;
