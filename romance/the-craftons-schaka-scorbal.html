  <title>The Craftons - Schaka Scorbal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Craftons are an upscale African American family. They live in an upper middle-class neighborhood on Chicago&amp;#39;s Hyde Park. Like most families, they have their secrets. The father, Tom Crafton is bisexual. The twins, Carter and Caitlin, have an ongoing sexual relationship and have a child together. The mother is sexually frustrated and she is eyeing the her son to scratch that itch! Oh yeah! And the maid practices obeah!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
June Crafton was the antithesis of the stereotypical Black woman. She was not a big busted, big butt statuesque woman. She was petite Creole with tiny sensitive 32B breasts. Her skin color and her strawberry blond hair were like that female ex-United States senator from Louisiana.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was trying to process the advice her doctor had given her. They were discussing the side effects of her hormone replacement therapy. Initially, her doctor told her the side effects had to be tolerated. She would only be on HRT for a brief time. When June balked, her doctor moved around her desk and sat next to her patient. She advised her that while she could not prescribe it, marijuana might relieve the symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Distracted, she made her way down the hall to her son&amp;#39;s room. The doctor had also said her hormone replacement therapy seemed to be going well despite her periods of almost intolerable sexual arousal. She said that happened in some women. Even now, her secretions soaked her panties. She wondered if Miss Curry&amp;#39;s tea has anything to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;
She froze as she passed the open door of Carter&amp;#39;s bathroom. The commode was parallel to the bathroom door. She saw her son in profile. Her knees almost buckled as she saw the thick yellow stream spewing with the force of a fire hose from his dark Coke can size cock. It drooped fully 3&amp;quot; from where his hand gripped it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dammit, Carter, I have told you repeatedly to close the fucking bathroom door!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry. Mom, but I thought I was home alone until I heard the elevator!&amp;quot; Carter felt an odd thrill.&amp;nbsp; His mother&amp;#39;s eyes were glued to his cock. Thinking back to the conversation with Caitlin, he exaggerated, shaking the last drops off before stuffing his cock back in his shorts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
June Crafton unconsciously licked her lips. Her eyes trailed up his lightly muscled body with the faint hint of a six-pack. She took in his broad shoulders, thick neck, neatly trimmed beard, and gleaming shaved head. Her pussy juices gushed and ran down her leg. Lord, she thought, I hope this new lower dose HRT patch works better than the others do. I&amp;#39;m chafed from being wet all the time." />
