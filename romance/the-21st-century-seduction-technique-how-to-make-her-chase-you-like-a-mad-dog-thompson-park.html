  <title>The 21st Century Seduction Technique: How to make her chase you like a mad dog - Thompson Park</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Countless books have been written on this subject, many speakers have spoken on it, yet there is no definite rule as to how to get a girl to like you - and fast too. Have you ever watched babies play with toys? When you give a baby a new toy, the old becomes... old-fashioned, if you take the new toy away, the old one becomes her best friend again. That is the nature of girls; they are not sure of what they want and will get attracted and stick to you if you know how to play your game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The game, which was broken down totally in the book &amp;ldquo;The 21st Century Seduction Technique&amp;rdquo; talks about using the act of seduction to make girls like and run after you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most men I know want to seduce a girl fast and they have asked me on a few occasions on how a man can perform a fast seduction and get the girl he wanted in no time. In this book, you are guided through the process of making the girl of your dream run after you.&lt;br /&gt;
Lets get started!" />
