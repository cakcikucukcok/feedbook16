  <title>Perfect Surrender - Mia London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She denied herself. Lied to herself. And she was miserable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Lauren Knight had the best plan. She and her brother had inherited an estate worth millions from an aunt who&amp;rsquo;d lived in Paris. Lauren&amp;nbsp;needed to&amp;nbsp;go to Paris for four weeks to settle the estate. How lucky can a girl be? In her absence, her brother would manage the spa. Just one minor detail--he&amp;rsquo;d need to act gay. Since it was only for four weeks, she thought this was all a cake-walk. Until she met Andre.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As Andre Beauchamp snapped a few pictures from the top of the Eiffel Tower, he had no idea he would become the savior to a scared, albeit, lovely American woman. He was inexplicably drawn to Lauren, and despite her very short stay in Paris, he found himself falling for her.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One week in Paris and Lauren was already wishing she could stay longer. She loved spending time with Andre, but when her world came crashing down around her, she had no choice.&lt;br /&gt; She had to return to the States, and leave Andre behind. Forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
