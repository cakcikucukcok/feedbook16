&lt;p&gt;So, sit and read about a different kind of war.  A war that had no rules, no sides, no objectives, no honor, no results, no history, no monuments, no winners, and no official players.  It was real to those who lived it, men and women.   Daily life was not filled with the dread of being killed by the civilian population, as in Vietnam.  Americans patrolled, set ambushes, spied on the Khmer Rouge or Pathet Lao, and saw a lot of Cambodia or Laos, then came back for a cold beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, some of them didnt come back at all." />
