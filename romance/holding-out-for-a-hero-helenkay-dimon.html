Unfortunately, the best hero in all the Hawaiian Islands is set on turning in his badge and getting his excellent butt into another line of work. If that wasn&#39;t enough, Josh Windsor also has a big-time grudge against Deana herself. But if there&#39;s anything being rich, smart, and stubborn has taught Deana, it&#39;s never to settle for second best.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josh has had it with saving people. He&#39;s had it with getting hauled into court. And boy, has he ever had it with Deana. Or well, he hasn&#39;t had it. Yet. But the more she pops up sounding infuriating and looking good enough to eat, the more her hot bod and her cold case wriggle into his mind.
