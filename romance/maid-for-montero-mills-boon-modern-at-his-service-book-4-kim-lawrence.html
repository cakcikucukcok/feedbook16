          &lt;strong&gt;Hired as his mistress!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Zoe Grace is terrible at being housekeeper of the Montero Estate. So bad that she faces being fired after just two weeks! Desperate to keep her job, she’ll do anything to convince her handsome Spanish boss to give her just one more chance… Isandro Montero cannot believe that his new housekeeper is so inept! She has to go – rápido!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Except firing beautiful Zoe would ruin his reputation, as she has two young charges to care for. So Isandro will put Zoe where he can keep his eye on her – and maybe his hands… In his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘It’s hard to find the time to write a review for Kim Lawrence when you can never put her books down!’ – &lt;em&gt;Hollie, 37, Exmouth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
