  <title>Mr. Cavendish, I Presume - Julia Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amelia Willoughby has been engaged to the Duke of Wyndham for as long as she can remember. Literally. A mere six months old when the contracts were signed, she has spent the rest of her life waiting. And waiting. And waiting . . . for Thomas Cavendish, the oh-so-lofty duke, to &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; get around to marrying her. But as she watches him from afar, she has a sneaking suspicion that he never thinks about her at all . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s true. He doesn&#39;t. Thomas rather likes &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; a fianc&amp;#233;e&amp;#8212;all the better to keep the husband-hunters at bay&amp;#8212;and he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; intend to marry her . . . eventually. But just when he begins to realize that his bride might be something more than convenient, Thomas&#39;s world is rocked by the arrival of his long-lost cousin, who may or may not be the true Duke of Wyndham. And if Thomas is not the duke, then he&#39;s not engaged to Amelia. Which is the cruelest joke of all, because this arrogant and illustrious duke has made the mistake of falling in love . . . with his own fianc&amp;#233;e!&lt;/p&gt;" />
