  <title>Wild Licks - Cecilia Tan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pleasure knows no bounds . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Gwen Hamilton is always looking for a thrill. Not even running a secret BDSM club can fulfill her true desires. It&#39;s only when she&#39;s backstage at a rock concert and attracts the eye -- and experienced hands -- of guitarist Mal Kennealy that she finds that perfect combination of danger and excitement she&#39;s been craving. Calling herself &quot;Excrucia,&quot; she revels in his uncompromising dominance each night. And yet by day, he knows her only as Gwen, his new escort for public appearances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Excrucia blows Mal&#39;s mind with her enthusiastic submission to his harshest commands. Even though he has a reputation for never seeing the same woman twice, he can&#39;t help being tempted by the woman willing to fulfill his every fantasy. And when Mal discovers that Gwen -- the sweet arm candy designed to soften his surly public image -- is really Excrucia, he never wants to let her go. Finally he can indulge his absolute power. But dancing too recklessly on the razor&#39;s edge could cut deeper than he bargained for . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Everyone knows Cecilia Tan is the queen of &lt;i&gt;hot&lt;/i&gt;, but she&#39;s also the queen of wit and angst and voice. &lt;i&gt;Taking the Lead&lt;/i&gt; is a book that grabs you by the collar and gives you flirty-eyes. It will tell you, &#39;Go sit, over there in the corner chair, and don&#39;t get up until you&#39;re done.&#39; You will do it-absolutely and happily-because Cecilia knows exactly what you want.&quot; -- Christina Lauren, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Bastard&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sweet Filthy Boy&lt;/i&gt;" />
