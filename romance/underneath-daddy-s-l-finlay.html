  <title>Underneath Daddy - S.L. Finlay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
He confesses his desire to her. He&amp;rsquo;s not just your regular shade of kinky man, wanting to spank a girls ass while he takes her, he&amp;rsquo;s into something else entirely. When she discovers the taboo role play he desires, she&amp;rsquo;s at first taken off guard but curious what it would be like to try it out. This sexy short story power play, spanking, objectification, DD/lg role play and light BDSM.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I am a kinky person. I have rough, kinky sex. There is no &amp;lsquo;kinkiest thing I have done&amp;rsquo;, as most of the things I do are pretty kinky.&amp;rdquo; His answer was earnest, and took me off guard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I looked him over then, unsure what to make of his comments. He had seemed so kind to me. He was very sweet and thoughtful, and not what I would think of if I had to point to a kinky person. Sure, we all had kinky things we liked to do, but this sounded more serious than all that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leaning closer, I asked, &amp;ldquo;what sort of kinky things are you into?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His smile, wicked and large, loomed over me then, &amp;ldquo;well, I like, different things&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh?&amp;rdquo; I pressed. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to put up with his vagueness much longer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes. I like to be rough with a girl, I like to punish her when she&amp;rsquo;s naughty, and to reward her when she&amp;rsquo;s good.&amp;rdquo; His words made my pussy twitch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I smiled at him then, we were on the same page. I liked all of these things too. &amp;ldquo;How naughty do I have to be to be punished?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His eyes were sincere as he answered, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s very presumptuous of you&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Is it?&amp;rdquo; I asked cheekily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why yes, it is. This is only a second date after all&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; he reminded me." />
