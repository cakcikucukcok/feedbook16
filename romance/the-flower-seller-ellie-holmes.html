  <title>The Flower Seller - Ellie Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jessie Martin believes that when it comes to love there are three types of people: the skimmers, the bottom dwellers and the ones who dive for pearls.&amp;nbsp; Jessie is a pearl diver. She had thought her husband William was a pearl diver too. But when William leaves her for a much younger woman, it&amp;rsquo;s not just Jessie&amp;rsquo;s heart that is broken, her ability to trust is shattered too. All Jessie wanted was a love she could believe in. Was that so much to ask?&amp;nbsp; Loyalty it seems has gone out of fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refusing to retire from the battlefield of life, Jessie resolves to put her heartache behind her. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be that woman who was too scared to love again. There has to be another pearl diver out there; all she has to do is find him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urged on by her sassy best friend, Anne and her daughter Hannah, Jessie makes three New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions: get a divorce, get a promotion, get a life. Enthusiastically embracing her new start, Jessie sets about making all her resolutions come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fate brings handsome flower seller Owen Phillips into her life, will Jessie have the courage of her convictions? Can she take her heart in her hands and give it away again? Hope springs eternal they say but a bruised heart needs to time to heal. Will Owen have the patience to understand? Will Jessie be brave enough to take that leap of faith?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time summer holds her firmly in it&amp;rsquo;s warm embrace, Jessie&amp;rsquo;s monochrome world of heartache has been transformed into one full of colour, romance and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessie can hardly believe her luck.&amp;nbsp; Can Owen really be the one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All things seem possible and even husband William&amp;rsquo;s attempts to bully Jessie into a less than fair divorce settlement don&amp;rsquo;t have the power to upset her as they once might have. Supported by Owen, Jessie stands her ground. Putting William&amp;rsquo;s deceit and betrayal firmly in the rear view mirror of her life, Jessie is full of hope for the future.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps loyalty and true love haven&amp;rsquo;t gone out of fashion after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When autumn&amp;rsquo;s burnished hues colour the world around her, Jessie looks forward to cosy nights by log fires with her handsome flower seller. But is Owen really the pearl diver Jessie had hoped for? Or is Jessie&amp;rsquo;s fragile trust about to be shattered all over again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flower Seller&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an engaging and page-turning read full of love, deceit, betrayal and hope.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This romantic tale follows Jessie from the depths of winter, to the excitement of spring through a hot and passionate summer to the turmoil and drama of a stormy autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a second winter approaches and her world is once more turned upside down, will Jessie ever find a love she can believe in with a man she can trust?&lt;/p&gt;" />
