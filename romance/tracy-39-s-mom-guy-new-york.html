  <title>Tracy&#39;s Mom - Guy New York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tracy&amp;#39;s Mom is hot. I know, Tracy is my girlfriend, and I should pretend I don&amp;#39;t notice these things, but that&amp;#39;s just not how it goes. Besides, if there was a rumor going around school that your girlfriend&amp;#39;s mom had made a porno back in the 90&amp;#39;s, you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to keep your eyes off her either.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, what was I supposed to do when Ms. Sullivan asked me to come over and help out one weekend when Tracy was out of town? I mean, come on. I&amp;#39;m a nice guy, it would have been rude not to lend a hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Besides, I absolutely had to know what went on in that movie she made.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you can probably guess, this is a dirty story intended for grownups. Reader discretion is advised. And probably a candle, some personal lubrication and a little peace and quiet." />
