          &lt;strong&gt;NANNY WANTED &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Single mom seeks experienced live-in carer for baby boy. Immediate start. Fly-by-nights need not apply. Nick Joseph was every woman&#39;s fantasy: darkly handsome and great with kids. Linda just couldn&#39;t say no when he offered his services as temporary nanny to her baby boy. Soon she was as attached to Nick as little Rory was.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Nick had made it clear he was not a marrying kind of man, so how could Linda tell him that she wanted him to look after her , and not just Rory, permanently? What&#39;s more, how would Nick react when he learned that he was caring for his own son?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;NANNY WANTED!&lt;em&gt; They need a nanny - and look what they get!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
