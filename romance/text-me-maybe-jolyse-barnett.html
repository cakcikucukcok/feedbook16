The characters are complex yet likable. The story is sweetly romantic, yet at the same time satisfyingly sexy. I loved it and am looking forward to more books from this talented author.<br /><b><i>Text Me, Maybe - Kindle edition by Barnett, Jolyse ...</i></b> | Jolyse Barnett hit a home run with Text Me, Maybe. Part Cyrano De Bergerac, Text Me brings the best of both worlds to the forefront with subtle charm and modern sex appeal. The comedy of errors just adds to the irresistible quality of the story. For me, Ms. Barnett embodied the sweet, shyness that makes falling in love so special.<br /><b><i>Text Me, Maybe by Jolyse Barnett - Goodreads</i></b> | Text Me, Maybe Paperback â€“ May 9, 2016 by Jolyse Barnett (Author)<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Text Me, Maybe - Jolyse Barnett</a> </h3></p><hr/>
