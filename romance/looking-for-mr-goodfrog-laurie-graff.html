          &lt;strong&gt;A Fact About Frogging &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With new species discovered every day, it’s hard to find a rule to catch a good frog, except to say that when it comes to frogs there are no rules at all. Karrie Kline had kissed her share of frogs. But when it came to finding her prince her pond was dry.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With disappointments ranging from a Colorado bound Casonova to a lascivious lawyer she meets online, Karrie’s frustration climbs so high even dreams of meeting her match on her own reality show become a nightmare. But she still has her tales.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An enterprising actress, Karrie turns her dating stories into a successful one-woman show. Has her quest to put her bad-date karma to good use turned her into a dating pariah? Her old frogs are hopping out of the woodwork.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But offstage, Karrie journeys back to the beginning to figure out how she got here. From finding her very first tadpole on up to her biggest horniest toad, Karrie comes away with an even stronger sense of herself and relationships, passing on a prince for her own good frog.&lt;/p&gt;
