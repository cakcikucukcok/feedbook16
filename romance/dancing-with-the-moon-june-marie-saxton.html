At the tender age of seven, Sabrina witnessed the murder of her father. She tucked a crucial piece of evidence away, burying it beneath her childhood treasures. Likewise, she hid the haunted, forbidden pains of sorrow deep within her soul. As Sabrina struggles to keep the past locked away, golden opportunities of promise present themselves. Delicious relationships are formed, and even though Sabrina never expects it, happiness dances on every horizon. Sabrina stumbles through a first love and onward to a lasting one. Characters from her childhood reemerge; both good and bad. Sabrina eventually battles the searing, tormented demons of yesterday. Long awaited peace infuses Sabrina&#39;s soul, when at last the festering, infected secrets are confronted and justice is served. Sabrina defies social prejudice against her youth as she listens to the promptings of her heart and charts her own course into adulthood.&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
