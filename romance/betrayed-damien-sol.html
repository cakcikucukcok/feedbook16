  <title>Betrayed! - Damien Sol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Rob returns home early from a business trip that he had to cover for his brother. Only to hear some strange and disturbing noises from his bedroom. What he finds shatters his world as he sees his brother fucking his new wife on his own bed!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t tease me Robbie,&amp;rdquo; Kate pouted as Rob kissed up one thigh dancing along the edges of her cunt while his lips trailed down her other thigh. Her nose wiggled as her arousal hung in the air. Her back arched as she whimpered once she felt those taunting lips of his wrapping around her wet sex. &amp;ldquo;Yes Robbie!&amp;rdquo; Kate howled in joy as she felt that probing tongue curling inside of her canal. How she loved how he did that. &amp;ldquo;Fuck! Mmmhmm,&amp;rdquo; she growled, &amp;ldquo;lick that pussy baby!&amp;rdquo; Kate demanded as her nails scraped along his scalp. Sucking in a breath, her mouth formed into an &amp;lsquo;O&amp;rsquo;, her diaphragm convulsed rapidly before that silent wail caught up to her quaking body. &amp;ldquo;Robert!&amp;rdquo; she screamed as her thighs squeezed his head, her nectar came flooding out as she came for the man she loved. Her hands trailed along his chest, smiling seductively at him as he moved up her body. Even though she knew what was going to come next, that didn&amp;rsquo;t make her heart any less nervous than it already was. Gasping as Rob&amp;rsquo;s free hand ran the crown of his rod through her saturated lips. Her hands grasped his arms to as he neared the entrance to her paradise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to put it in slowly, alright?&amp;rdquo; Rob said, as those blue eyes stared up at him. Feeling her nails digging into his skin as his head pressed against that tight little hole. Watching how her body arched as that mushroom top breached her threshold. Leaning down, kissing her softly to enforce their connection as his cock slowly inched deeper into her cunt. Rob couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe how warm, how wet, how tight, and how oh so welcoming that velvet pocket was until he was hilt deep in that glistening love tunnel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh Robbie&amp;hellip; I feel all of you inside of me,&amp;rdquo; Kate sighed dreamily. All the wet, horny, blissful daydreams she&amp;rsquo;d had of this moment didn&amp;rsquo;t compare to how it truly felt as his shaft sat snugly within her folds. The back of her head pressed against the pillow; her breasts undulated as he thrust his cock into her. A luscious moan rolled off her lips as his right hand held onto her ass as he sent that hard pole deep into her mound. A rippling wave of pleasure started from the core of her womb and gradually built as its brethren gathered in its wake. Panting heavily as Rob slowly increased his pace. Biting her lip, her eyes gazed down her body, watching how that rod surged into her. The way her juices glistened in the light as he withdrew it from the heat of her womanhood. Her eyes widened as she watched his hand reach down, Kate released a high pitched squeal as his thumb softly rolled along her clit. &amp;ldquo;Fuck! Robbie, you&amp;rsquo;re going to make me&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Kate was floating in a sea of euphoria as her body succumbed to the sheer pleasure of her orgasm. It was nothing like the orgasms before it. Sure they were great, and she loved that it was Rob that was the one who gave them to her; yet this feeling, this momentous, intoxicating, body numbing feeling outplaced all those orgasms before it.&lt;br /&gt;
