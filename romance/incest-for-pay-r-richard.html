  <title>Incest For Pay - R. Richard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Jack and Jade are outstanding students and they each get good jobs right after graduation. They buy a house and start the good life. Then they both get laid off, after a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jack gets a good job, then finds out that to keep the job, he and Jade have to get into partner swapping. He can&amp;#39;t another job again, so soon after his layoff, so he and Jade have to partner swap.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
Jade says, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;ll try to learn some more about Gwen, as a person when we do our little shopping expedition. It might just be useful to know exactly how Gwen thinks, what her background is, that sort of thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I say, &amp;ldquo;Good idea! I&amp;#39;ll try to learn some more about Gerry as well. However, I suspect that I won&amp;#39;t make any really startling discoveries.&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the guys I went to high school with would want pretty much what Gerry wants, if they had the economic power to make it happen. I suspect that Gerry is just a guy who graduated from high school, but never really left.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jade asks, &amp;ldquo;Is Gerry not too smart then?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I say, &amp;ldquo;Gerry is quite intelligent. He knows a lot about people and how to manipulate them. He&amp;#39;s not going to come out on the short end of any business deal because he got outsmarted. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t think he has much concern for ethics. I&amp;#39;m not going to try to outsmart Gerry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jade says, &amp;ldquo;Probably just as well. I get the same reading that you do from Gerry. As long as he gets what he wants, we&amp;#39;re probably safe. If we don&amp;rsquo;t play his game, we lose our jobs. Maybe I can get an in with Gwen, when we go shopping. I&amp;#39;ll have to try and see.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I say, &amp;ldquo;Jade, be very careful. If I had a couple of years of experience and a good record, we could just walk away from Gerry and I could get another good job. We can&amp;rsquo;t do that now if we hope to have any kind of a life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jade says, &amp;ldquo;Jack, if I had a couple of years of experience, I could almost certainly get another job. A job where I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to screw to keep the job. You may be good at your work, but I&amp;#39;m good with people. Good with people gets you hired a lot faster than just talent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I say, &amp;ldquo;Since good with people, looks like a movie star and is also talented couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep you from being laid off, we have to be very careful here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jade says, &amp;ldquo;Ooohh! I like what you just said.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I say, &amp;ldquo;Then you like to hear that you are good with people and talented?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jade smirks at me and says, &amp;ldquo;That too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I spend the next week working very hard. I manage to land a new account at work and Gerry is very happy with me. However, Gerry isn&amp;#39;t so happy with me that I can stop pimping my wife just yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jade shops with Gwen. Jade also mines Gwen for information. It turns out that Gwen is a rich bitch. Gwen&amp;rsquo;s family has the money that let Gerry expand a small business operation into a very profitable niche player. Gwen was a wild child who was always in trouble and often just saved from jail or worse by her family. Gwen latched on to Gerry because he was a guy who could make the kind of money that she needs to live the life she wants. She&amp;#39;s apparently not all that happy with Gerry and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really care so much for Gerry the person, but rather Gerry the businessman. Apparently Gwen initially kept herself under control, mainly because she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to lose Gerry the businessman. However, when Gerry decided to screw other ladies, Gwen could then screw other men and Gerry had no real defense." />
