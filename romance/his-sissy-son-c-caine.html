  <title>His Sissy Son - C. Caine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Lucas Dyson&amp;#39;s one regret is that he has never been able to connect with his grown son Terry. Sensitive and feminine, Terry has never lived up to his dad&amp;#39;s manly example. When Terry comes for a visit, Lucas hopes for a reconciliation...but Terry is now Terri, a beautiful young transsexual. That night, Lucas will be tied down by his sissy son and forced to deal with twisted pleasures he&amp;#39;s always desired, but never admitted to, even to himself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Lucas didn&amp;rsquo;t put on the TV in his room. He broke into the bottle of bourbon he kept in his nightstand, though, and made friends with it. Before he finally fell asleep, he and the bottle had become very good friends indeed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The thing that bothered him even more than Terry&amp;rsquo;s dressing as a girl was the fact that he had felt momentarily attracted to him, even turned on. Granted, that was before he realized &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo; was Terry, but in a way that made it worse. Not only could he not immediately recognize his own son in drag, but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t even tell a boy from a girl. That he couldn&amp;rsquo;t blame on Terry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Luckily, he had his new friend Mr. Bottle to reassure him on that score.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he finally woke up, it was to a strange combination of eye-hurting sunlight and dick-stiffening pleasure. Someone had his half-erect cock in a tight grip, and was licking his cockhead with the kind of slow, even strokes he loved. Just the way Susan used to lick him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This thought&amp;mdash;combined with the lingering effects of the bottle&amp;mdash;prevented Lucas from thinking too hard about the situation. He was content to lay back and relish the slow tongue-strokes being lavished over his dick&amp;rsquo;s sensitive skin. Whoever it was knew what she was doing; her tongue was as practiced as the most seasoned whore&amp;rsquo;s. She used the tip of her tongue around the rim of Lucas&amp;rsquo; cockhead, and washed the tiny opening of his piss-hole. She paid special attention to the tiny ridge of flesh under his head, sometimes licking it, sometimes thumbing it like a joystick.&lt;br /&gt;
