  <title>An Unlikely Lady - Rachelle Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who Is Honesty McGuire?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what undercover Pinkerton agent Jesse Justiss wants to know. Honesty claims to be a helpless innocent alone in the big bad West -- but Jesse&amp;#39;s been conned by the best of&amp;#39;em...and this sassy beauty is the best he&amp;#39;s ever seen!Jesse can&amp;#39;t trust anything but a feeling in his gut that this double-dealing lady might help him locate a missing heiress...and this fire in his heart that insists Honesty is someone he&amp;#39;d like to know intimately!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honesty herself doesn&amp;#39;t know who she is -- not after the shocking confession from the grifter she thought was her father! She doesn&amp;#39;t know who Jesse Justiss really is either -- the stranger with smoldering blue eyes who she&amp;#39;s hoodwinked into accompanying her as she hunts down her past. Jesse&amp;#39;s strong, sculpted body may be as tempting as sin...but he&amp;#39;s obviously spinning her some tall tales of his own! Can Honesty and Jesse stop scamming each other long enough to passionately explore their true feelings -- and their blossoming, most unlikely love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
