  <title>The Ballad of Dixon Bell (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (At the Carolina Diner, Book 2) - Lynnette Kent</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;He&#39;s always loved her.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dixon Bell has loved Kate Bowdrey for as long as he can remember. Everybody in town knew him as the shy kid who carried around a guitar–and as the guy who disappeared after high school graduation. After thirteen years away–spent nursing a broken heart and becoming a successful songwriter–he&#39;s discovered that Kate is available again, so he&#39;s coming home to New Skye to make all his dreams come true.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But L. T. LaRue–Kate&#39;s soon-to-be ex-husband and one of the most powerful men in town–has other plans for Dixon. Dixon just happens to own a beautiful old plantation house, and L.T. wants to use that property for high-priced condos. And he wants Dixon to stay the hell away from Kate. But Dixon&#39;s not selling–he has big plans for that house, plans that include Kate and her kids. And he&#39;s certainly not giving up the woman he loves. Not again. Not without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
