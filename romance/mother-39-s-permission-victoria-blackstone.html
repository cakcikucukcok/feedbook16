  <title>Mother&#39;s Permission - Victoria Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
Corinne&#39;s hormones are raging, and her focus is squarely on daddy, who&#39;s only too happy to oblige her... if she can get her mother&#39;s permission. The task at first seems daunting, but with daddy&#39;s guidance, she turns on the charm, and turns an already warm relationship with her mother into a simmering delicacy. Our sweet, little charmer is quick to learn that, although daddy fills a certain void, mommy&#39;s love is what she really craves.
EXCERPT
I removed my shorts and took a deep breath before easing my panties over my hips. They fell to the floor in a silent puddle.
“Perfect,” she whispered. She reached out to draw a fingertip down the center of my chest. “I made you,” she breathed. “You’re a part of me.”
“Daddy says I taste like you,” I said, my voice barely reaching my own ears.
Her gaze came up, her head shaking. “He tasted you?” I couldn’t stop the smile. Her brows drew. “Did he go down on you?”
“No, Momma.”
She looked confused. “Then... how?”
I smiled, my brow twitching as I moved, slipping my hand between my legs, holding my breath, my gaze on her face, hers on my sex as I slipped my fingers between my lips, coating them. I brought them up to her, touching them to her lips, moaning when she opened for me. She stared into my eyes as she cleaned them off, her tongue swirling around and between them. She grabbed my wrist, pulling my fingers free. “Lay down, baby girl.”
