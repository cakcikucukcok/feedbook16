  <title>To Kiss a Sheikh (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Teresa Southwick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Desperate for a job, American beauty Crystal Rawlins would have done &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to become nanny to Sheik Fariq Hassan&#39;s children. And telling a little white lie about her looks to secure a dream job in an exotic location seemed like a very small detail. But then she met her boss, and saw the definition of tall, dark and…wow!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Burned before, Sheik Fariq Hassan didn&#39;t trust attractive women. Fortunately, his new nanny was far from stunning. Still, he was captivated by her fiery spirit–and by her passionate kisses. She obviously shared his attraction, so why did she keep pulling away from him? And what secrets was she hiding behind those glasses and bulky clothing…?&lt;/p&gt;
