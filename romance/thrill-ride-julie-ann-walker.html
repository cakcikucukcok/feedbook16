  <title>Thrill Ride - Julie Ann Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;A first-rate thrill ride.&quot;—&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;,  Starred Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HE&#39;S GONE ROGUE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ex-navy SEAL Rock Babineaux is as Cajun as they come—spicy,  sexy, and more than a bit wicked. But would he actually betray his country?  Even his best friends on the special-ops Black Knights team aren&#39;t sure they  can trust him. Now the target of a massive manhunt, Rock knows the only way to  protect the team—especially his partner, Vanessa—is to run...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHE WON&#39;T BACK DOWN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rock might think he can outmaneuver them all, but he hasn&#39;t  counted on how stubborn Vanessa Cordero can be. And she refuses to cut him  loose. Sure, her partner has his secrets, but there&#39;s no one in the world she&#39;d  rather have by her side in a tight spot. Which is good because she and Rock are  about to get very tight...&lt;/p&gt;
