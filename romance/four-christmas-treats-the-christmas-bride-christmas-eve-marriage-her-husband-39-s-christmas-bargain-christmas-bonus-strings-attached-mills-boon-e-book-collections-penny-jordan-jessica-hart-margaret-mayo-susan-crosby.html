  <title>Four Christmas Treats: The Christmas Bride / Christmas Eve Marriage / Her Husband&#39;s Christmas Bargain / Christmas Bonus, Strings Attached (Mills &amp; Boon e-Book Collections) - Penny Jordan, Jessica Hart, Margaret Mayo, Susan Crosby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Treat yourself to four unputdownable romances this Christmas…&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Christmas Bride&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Jason McCready and Cary Adams were thrown together on a Yuletide skiing trip meant to please their children, they struck sparks off each other immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then they realized that the fire burning between them was more than mere chemistry. It was the harbinger of a love that would warm them through the holidays… and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Christmas Eve Marriage&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A bride for the holidays…?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The only thing Thea&#39;s looking for on her vacation on the Greek island of Crete is a little R and R–she certainly doesn&#39;t expect to find herself roped in to being Rhys Kingsford&#39;s pretend fiancée! It definitely isn&#39;t relaxing being around Rhys–in fact being with him is exciting, exhilarating…and everything Thea&#39;s ever wanted!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Back home, Christmas is coming and reality sinks in. Perhaps it was just a holiday fling? Rhys is a single dad, and Thea&#39;s not sure there&#39;s room in his life for her. But Rhys has other ideas&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Her Husband&#39;s Christmas Bargain&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;The Italian&#39;s marriage demand…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Italian businessman Luigi Costanzo discovers that Megan, his beautiful estranged wife, is also the mother of his child, he is incensed! She&#39;s left him no alternative: he will do anything in his power to possess his wife and child. Megan is less than impressed when Luigi turns up on her doorstep—the week before Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luigi is as arrogant as ever—and still as impossible to resist. But Luigi is adamant…Megan will be a wife to him—in every way—once more!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Christmas Bonus, Strings Attached&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Secretary Lyndsey couldn’t believe her sexy private eye boss had actually proposed! Of course, it wasn’t for real – although they’d be sleeping together! Perhaps if she took his mind off business, she could make him yearn to spend this Christmas Day – and every day after – with her…&lt;/p&gt;
