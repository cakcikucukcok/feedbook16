Ambition. Violence. Those are the &quot;values&quot; Olivia Rashidi learned from her Russian mob family-and the values she must leave behind for the sake of her daughter. When she meets Cillian O&#39;Malley, she recognizes the red flag of his family name . . . yet she still can&#39;t stop herself from seeing the smoldering, tortured man. To save her family, Olivia sets out to discover Cillian&#39;s own secrets, but the real revelation is how fast-and how hard-she&#39;s falling for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Plagued by a violent past, Cillian is more vulnerable than anyone realizes. Anyone except Olivia, whose beauty, compassion, and pride have him at &quot;hello,&quot; even if she&#39;s more inclined to say good-bye to an O&#39;Malley. While his proposal of sex with no strings seems simple, what he feels for her isn&#39;t, especially after he learns that she belongs to a rival crime family. Cillian knows that there is no escape from the life, but Olivia may be worth trying-and dying-for . . ." />
