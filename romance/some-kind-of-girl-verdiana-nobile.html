  <title>Some Kind Of Girl - Verdiana Nobile</title>
      <meta name="description" content="London. A guy meets a girl. But this is not a love story. Not a traditional one, at least.&lt;br/&gt;
She has petroleum coloured hair, she&#39;s a bit &#39;wacky, talkative, pushy. He, a brilliant young journalist trapped in an unrewarding job.&lt;br/&gt;
Together they plunge to the discovery of their city, turning every date into a little adventure, learning to know each other and dreaming about the future.&lt;br/&gt;
But, one morning, she disappears. Without a note, with no explanation. Every object related to her seems magically vanished.&lt;br/&gt;
Finding her, for him, becomes an obsession leading him to doubt himself, to face uncomfortable truths, to re-evaluate his choices, his relationships with other poeple, the whole concept he has always had of himself and his world.&lt;br/&gt;
Who really is Leila? How much is she real?&lt;br/&gt;" />
