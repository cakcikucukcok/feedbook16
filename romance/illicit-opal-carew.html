  <title>Illicit - Opal Carew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What began as a steamy weekend fling is about to change their lives forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lindsay receives a mysterious invitation to live out her most illicit fantasies, she thinks it&#39;s her best friend playing a joke.  Little does she know, the invitation is from someone else.  Someone who knows her deepest desires...and intends to fulfill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erik is a man of many secrets, and he intends to keep it that way.  When he invites Lindsay to his mansion, he thinks it&#39;s just for a steamy weekend fling.  But from their first night together, there&#39;s an inexplicably deep connection that shakes him to his core.  And with Lindsay in his arms, he feels both thrilled and unnerved.  As Lindsay brings &lt;i&gt;his &lt;/i&gt;fantasies to life, he&#39;s unwilling to let her go. But can he tell her how he knows her deepest desires, and will she stay with him if she learns the truth? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re invited...to explore your most forbidden desires with ILLICIT from author Opal Carew.&lt;/p&gt;" />
