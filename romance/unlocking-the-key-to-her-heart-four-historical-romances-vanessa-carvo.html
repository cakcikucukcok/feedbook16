      <meta name="description" content="Mail Order Bride: The Irish Woman &amp; Her Mysterious Fiancé - An Irish woman is promised to a man in Texas by her father, in return for a dowry to be sent back to her family in Ireland.   The English Governess Meets The Cowboy - A governess from England is hired to go out west and become the teacher to a widower&#39;s four children, and perhaps, something much more.   Losing Her Cowboy Before She Can Marry Him - A woman decides to become a mail order bride but goes west under subterfuge - she already has a man lined up even though she will be supposedly matched up with a cowboy by the company who is paying her way.   Living Off The Land For Her Husband, is about an independent spark of a woman from London, suddenly deciding to become a mail order bride and live in the Old West. The trouble is...she has no clue how to cook, clean house, or even get along with another human being within the closeness that marriage brings; let alone learn the &#39;farm to table&#39; philosophy that will feed them both." />
