  <title>The Best Of Me (Mills &amp; Boon Temptation) - Tina Wainscott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Lucy Donovan has always subscribed to the finer things in life. That is, until a fateful trip to the Bahamas and an even more fateful encounter with the sexy, cynical Chris Maddox. His take on the world leaves her speechless. So does his gorgeous body. Lucy knows he brings out the best in her, but can she give everything up for him? For them?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chris Maddox is totally amazed by the incredible woman who keeps surprising him at every turn. Lucy is unlike anyone he&#39;s ever met, and she&#39;s the only one who&#39;s ever really gotten to him. He&#39;s not just taken with her beauty and sophistication–it&#39;s the woman inside that&#39;s captivated him. Chris knows she brings out the best in him, but can he ask her for all and let them risk having nothing instead?&lt;/p&gt;
