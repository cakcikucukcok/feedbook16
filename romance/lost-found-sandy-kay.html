  <title>Lost &amp; Found - Sandy Kay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Veronica Michaels had spent the past twenty years married to an angry, abusive man who stripped away every vestige of the poetic, independent, romantic writer she used to be. She had become a recluse, a mere shadow of the mother that her daughter Meg remembered. Roni felt trapped in a loveless marriage, burdened with debt, with no hope for a different life or a different future. 
When she was offered a chance for freedom, she grasped for it - even though it involved a bit of espionage, blackmail, and a dangerous escape for her life with the help of the very handsome father of a co-worker. 
Would Frank Harrison ever look at her as anything other than a desperate, weak woman needing protection, or was she destined to spend the rest of her life without the love she so longed for?" />
