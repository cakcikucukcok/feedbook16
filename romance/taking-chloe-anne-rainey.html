  <title>Taking Chloe - Anne Rainey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Merrick Vaughn couldn&#39;t be happier. His business is thriving and his marriage to the love of his life is amazing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until Chloe announces she wants to separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a desperate bid to keep from losing the only woman he&#39;s ever loved, Merrick proposes a deal. He&#39;ll let her go, but first she&#39;ll have to accompany him to Hawaii for a one-week vacation where he&#39;s in complete control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing Chloe wants is a divorce, but sharing a house with a workaholic stranger is tearing her apart. Taking a break to sort out her thoughts seems her only recourse. When Merrick offers a wicked proposition, she&#39;s both intrigued and scared. Will a week in a tropical paradise bring them closer or will it be their ultimate undoing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each novella in the Vaughn Series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Book 1: Touching Lace&lt;br&gt;Book 2: Tasting Candy&lt;br&gt;Book 3: Taking Chloe&lt;br&gt;Book 4: Tempting Grace&lt;/p&gt;" />
