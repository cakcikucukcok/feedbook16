  <title>Wickham&#39;s Diary - Amanda Grange</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;11 July 1784&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Why should I be beneath Fitzwilliam? I am just as handsome as he is; I am just as intelligent, even though he works harder at his books; and I am just as amusing; in fact I dare say I am a great deal more amusing, for Fitzwilliam is so proud he will not take the trouble to entertain other people. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yet although he is no better than me, when he grows up he will inherit Pemberley, and I will inherit nothing...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Austen&#39;s ultimate bad boy finally gets his say. Face with an uncertain future—while his friend Fitzwilliam Darcy is set for life—dastardly George Wickham plots and cavorts in this rollicking prequel to Pride and Prejudice. Bestselling author Amanda Grange daringly explores the inner turmoil and secret motivations of the character every Austen fan loves to hate...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;Mr. Darcy&#39;s Diary&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Grange tells Darcy&#39;s story in her own style, with charm and a gentle wit.
