  <title>Younger Than Springtime - Andrew M. Greeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;A Midwinter&#39;s Tale&lt;/i&gt; returns with a heartfelt sequel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father Andrew M. Greeley returns to the saga of the O&#39;Malley family with his signature blend of humor, classic American values and heart-rending storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles &quot;Chucky&quot; Cronin has come home to Chicago in one piece after a chaotic tour in post WWII Germany.  And though his family thinks he&#39;s &quot;become a man,&quot; Chucky knows he still has a lot of growing up to do.  Anxious to attend Notre Dame and get his life back on in order, Chucky is quickly sidetracked by the beautiful, raven-haired, haunting (and haunted) Rosemarie, a girl as fresh-faced and clever as she is doomed.  Conflicts with a mob boss and a tendency to ruffle the feathers of those in charge combine to land Chucky in even more hot water. Luckily, a quick wit and an old fashioned sense of right and wrong (along with a dose of Heavenly help) save him when tensions reach the boiling point.  Can Chucky come of age in a difficult and heady time, holding on to his integrity while discovering the secret to love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
