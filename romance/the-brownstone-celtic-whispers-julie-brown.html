  <title>The Brownstone: Celtic Whispers - Julie Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lilis anguish seeped from her pores back then, although she thought it was hidden behind a clever facade. The light can be ferocious, especially in the brownstone. Love can become a desperate beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brownstone is bustling as usual with new construction and now, new tenants. A wedding is on the fringe, and a newborn baby is coming home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Lili Wentworth there is only one thing that matters to her more than her family and friends and thats interpreting the messages she is channeling. Led with compassion she explores the complexities of moral choices and their emotional consequences, while being led by angels around her to find the sacred meaning within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow Lili to Quebec, and Vermont, as she seeks resolution with Coleman Kavanagh, a man she admits to loving. Her final decision rocks the foundation of the brownstone. With her friendships with Keith, Katherine and James on the line Lili boldly chooses an unexpected adventure that takes her into one of the most ancient spiritual practices known to man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startling secrets and unexpected twists surface with the guidance of Andrew Wentworths prophecies leaving his family with an understanding that love in its human form requires a balance of emotion and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Lili Wentworth moves past her most vulnerable stages, her intuition leads her to an astonishing discovery that will forever have her believing that there is so much more to life than the human eye can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get ready for, Celtic Whispers with an immensely satisfying conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
