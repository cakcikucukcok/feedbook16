  <title>Johnny Hawk Werewolf Hunter - S. M. Krantz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the stillness of a Texas evening, the younger brother of Johnny Hawk is brutally murdered and the killer left two legged wolf tracks. The horrible death ultimately drives Johnny away from his family. He joins John Coffee Hayes&#39; Rangers to fight in the Mexican American War but the experience hardens Johnny even more. He remains in Texas, a vigilante hunter until fate brings young Victoria Bryan into his life. They go their separate ways, but Hawk can&#39;t stop thinking about her. A few years later a young Navajo girl Johnny is living with is brutally murdered in the same terrible manner his brother had been. Horrified Hawk vows to hunt down this killer but when Tori Bryan comes back into his life his worst fears are realized when she is taken hostage by a band of cutthroats that unknowingly has a werewolf as a key member. Hawk must face his childhood fears in order to rescue Tori from something he understands little of but knows death is the only cure. Along the way he learns true love does heal deep wounds." />
