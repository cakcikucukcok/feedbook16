  <title>A Bride for a Blue-Ribbon Cowboy (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Judy Duarte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;HER CHALLENGE? TRANSFORMING FROM TOMBOY TO KNOCKOUT.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HER PRIZE? THE COWBOY OF HER DREAMS.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Outroping and outriding every man in Blossom was something Cindy Tucker could do with her eyes closed. But cooking, flirting and wearing high heels? Those were skills of a different kind–the kind she&#39;d surely need to lasso a r husband. And the one person she trusted to teach her was Blake Gray Feather. He was the only man who&#39;d ever made her lose her breath, who haunted her dreams, who hadn&#39;t yet figured out his childhood friend had grown up.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But now, with their late-night sweet talk and soft kisses, she was seeing a different look in Blake&#39;s eyes…and that gave Cindy a newfound confidence in her womanly abilities. Because he fully intended to put Blake&#39;s &quot;lessons&quot; to use to win the heart of the only cowboy she&#39;d ever loved…&lt;/p&gt;
