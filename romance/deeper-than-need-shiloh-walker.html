      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS.&lt;br&gt;Eager to put a dark, troubled past behind her, Trinity Ewing buys an old house that will make the perfect refuge for her and her young son once renovations are complete. The last thing on her mind is finding someone new...but the contractor she&#39;s hired is an irresistible distraction-and Trinity can&#39;t help but fantasize about all the business they could be doing behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SO DOES ONE MAN&#39;S TOUCH.&lt;br&gt;Noah Benningfield thought he&#39;d put his demons behind him. But the moment he lays eyes on Trinity. The temptation he feels is too powerful to deny. Soon the attraction between them explodes into something neither of them could have imagined. But their desire will be put to the test when a shocking local murder has them dodging danger at every turn. Can the beautiful and damaged Trinity trust someone like Noah, whose own past is as haunted as her own? The only thing she knows for sure is that she can&#39;t live without a man who makes her feel this good-over and over again...in &lt;i&gt;Deeper Than Need &lt;/i&gt;by Shiloh Walker.&lt;/p&gt;" />
