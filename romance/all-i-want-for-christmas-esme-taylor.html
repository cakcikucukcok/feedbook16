  <title>All I Want for Christmas - Esme Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best gifts are unwrapped...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A saucy Christmas novella to heat up your winter nights!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ella is dreading Christmas. She vowed to change her life this year, and although breaking up with her boring boyfriend was the first step, she&#39;s been too scared to take the next, and her life has become small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  But then, when working at a Christmas party, Ella meets Joe. The attraction is instant and convenient: neither is interested in more than a fling. While Ella&#39;s been stuck, Joe&#39;s been running. He&#39;s been travelling for a year and has no plans to stop, but he&#39;s home to spend Christmas with his huge, loud family. His father wants him to stay and join the family business, but Joe&#39;s not yet ready for that kind of commitment and isn&#39;t sure he&#39;ll ever be. But as the snow and the presents pile up - and Ella and Joe&#39;s clothes come off - Ella realises she needs to start living again. And that maybe all she wants for Christmas is Joe...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS is part of Hot Key Books&#39; exclusive new novella list, and one of a series of five available this Christmas. Unlock your naughty side!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br&gt;Esme Taylor spends her days dreaming about romantic scenarios (lately involving Benedict Cumberbatch, but subject to change) and is thrilled to have the opportunity to write them down. She&#39;s been writing fiction since she was a teen (romantic scenarios featuring George Michael), but didn&#39;t finish a novel until 2004 (romantic scenario featuring a thinly-disguised Matt Damon). She lives in Lancashire with her husband (looks a bit like Christopher Eccleston) and two children and is the author of three YA novels under her own name, Keris Stainton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
