  <title>The Mad Earl&#39;s Bride - Loretta Chase</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Originally appeared in the print anthology &lt;em&gt;Three Weddings and a Kis&lt;/em&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gwendolyn Adams is about to propose to an earl. On his deathbed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gwendolyn Adams isn&#39;t shocked at being asked to save a handsome earl&#39;s dying line, even when she learns the prospective bridegroom is seriously ill and possibly insane. She&#39;s quite a good nurse, after all, and her family is famous for producing healthy male children. Those stories about his riding the moors half-naked on a pale white horse? &lt;em&gt;Extremely&lt;/em&gt; intriguing&amp;#8212;especially after she gets her first look at the gorgeous lunatic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Earl of Rawnsley wants only to lose what&#39;s left of his mind in peace and privacy. But his busybody relatives have saddled him with a surprise bride and orders to sire an heir forthwith. (And they say &lt;em&gt;he&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; mad?) But with Gwendolyn, his health is returning, and his resistance ... crumbling. Is it possible that love is the finest madness of all?&lt;/p&gt;" />
