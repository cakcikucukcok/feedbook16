  <title>Touch of a Scoundrel - Mia Marlowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s a matter of honor, duty.  .  . and desire.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Griffin Nash, Earl of Devonwood, wants to believe that he&#39;s seducing Miss Emmaline Farnsworth out of protectiveness for his young brother. After all, if his brother is convinced that the tantalizing professor&#39;s daughter is unworthy of his trust, perhaps Teddy will lose all interest in such an inappropriate choice for his station. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in truth, something else motivates Devonwood: a scintillating vision he&#39;s had of a future tryst with the lovely Emmaline. A vision too realistic to be doubted--and too scaldingly passionate to be denied. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet Emmaline is not as easily tempted as Devonwood might have hoped--nor is she actually in pursuit of a wealthy husband. No, the real reason for her visit to the manor is something much more shocking.  .  . though being enticed by a dashing earl may prove to be a most welcome by-product of her schemes.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A smart and sexy tale.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Mary Jo Putney&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;lt;B.Praise for Mia Marlow and her novels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Marlowe proves she has the &amp;#8216;touch&#39; for strong heroines, wickedly sexy heroes, and love scenes so hot they singe the pages.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Jennifer Ashley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sensuality, sexuality, passion and mystery blend into a wonderfully entertaining tale.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Both historical and paranormal readers will love this crossover tale.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/i&gt; starred review" />
