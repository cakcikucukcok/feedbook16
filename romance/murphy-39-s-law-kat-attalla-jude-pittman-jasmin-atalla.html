  <title>Murphy&#39;s Law - Kat Attalla, Jude Pittman, Jasmin Atalla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fear and intimidation work. Ask Customs Agent Jack Murphy. He uses both to hunt felons. But instinct and experience fail when he sets out to retrieve Lilly McGrath-- a blonde bombshell who is either a willing participant or an innocent pawn in her boss&#39;s smuggling scam. Until Jack knows which, she&#39;s just another suspect. . Now he just needs to get his hormones in sync with his head. While working as an export clerk Lilly, stumbled upon her boss&#39;s illegal activities. After an attempt on her life, she flees to Europe to hide. Living on credit cards and her wits, she is constantly on the move—but no matter where she runs, she can’t lose the dangerously handsome stranger following her across the continent. In Genoa, Italy , her credit limit and luck finally run out. Once Jack grabs Lilly, Murphy’s Law dogs them at every turn. Someone is determined to see that Lilly never makes it back to the States to testify. The distrustful couple must learn to rely on each other if they are to survive. And for Lilly that means surrendering to a man who both infuriates and excites her." />
