&lt;p&gt;A week later, Eleanor opens the door to Lukas McKendrick, who offers to help the inexperienced plantation owners. Lukas, who is the wealthiest and loneliest man around, soon finds himself attracted to Eleanornot only because she is beautiful, but also because of her newfound exuberance for growing tea. As the tea crop succeeds and she becomes involved with the Gullah culture, Lukas quickly falls in love with Eleanor without her knowledge. As a chain of events sends her back to Paterson, Eleanor is led down a new path where she learns the truth and finally understands the meaning of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Woman Endures&lt;/i&gt; shares the poignant conclusion to the tale of a progressive woman as she faces new challenges and comes to realize that no matter what comes her way, she will endure.&lt;/p&gt;
