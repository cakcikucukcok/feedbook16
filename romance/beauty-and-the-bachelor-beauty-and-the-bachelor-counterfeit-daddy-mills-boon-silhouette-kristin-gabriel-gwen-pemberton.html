          &lt;strong&gt;Beauty and the Bachelor&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Whether you&#39;re looking for lattes for love, you&#39;ll find both at Café Romeo…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Noah Callahan was a charming playboy who loved beautiful women–at least for a night or two. But as tempted as he was by gorgeous Sabrina Lovett, he wasn&#39;t taking any chances! His aunt Sophie&#39;s bachelor traps had already snared his two older brothers. But when the feisty redhead threatened Café Romeo&#39;s reputation, he had to step in…and could only hope he didn&#39;t lost his heart to Sabrina in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Counterfeit Daddy&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Family foolery!&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chet James was getting rich writing a column about the trials and tribulations of being a single dad. Never mind that he was really a confirmed bachelor and childless! But when his editor, the tantalizing P.J. West, insisted on an exclusive week-in-the-life interview, he was left scrambling to borrow some kids and become the man she thought he was….&lt;/p&gt;
