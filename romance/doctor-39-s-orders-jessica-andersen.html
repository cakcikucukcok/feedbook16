Keeping their past relationship&amp;#151;and old feelings&amp;#151; secret was a challenge, especially once the beautiful new doctor uncovered a medical conspiracy and became a hot target. Parker had a reputation as driven and unforgiving, but being Mandy&#39;s personal bodyguard became the primary focus of his days&amp;#133;and led to long, passionate nights. Now pitting himself against a madman was dangerous but necessary if he was to achieve what he wanted: keeping Mandy safe.
