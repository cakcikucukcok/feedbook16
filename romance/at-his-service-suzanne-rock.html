  <title>At His Service - Suzanne Rock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An incendiary tale of erotic seduction-and the high stakes of surrender...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NO REQUEST WILL BE DENIED.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;To save his family&#39;s hotel empire, Leo Perconti arrives at Boston&#39;s Palazzo prepared to take no prisoners. His hedonistic siblings have let the grand hotel&#39;s standards slide, and the company is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. But before he takes on his family, he has a no-strings-attached arrangement to consider...Is it time to put the Do Not Disturb sign up on the door? Or is it too dangerous to mix work with no-holds-barred pleasure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IS THEIR DESIRE WORTH THE RISK?&lt;/b&gt;Sleeping with the boss was never part of hotel intern Karin Norell&#39;s plan. But she can&#39;t resist Leo&#39;s powerful allure.... sensual submission is downright addictive with Leo in control. But that addiction comes with a hefty price, and soon she&#39;s caught in a compromising position. Will Karin be strong enough to pay it? Because when it comes to passion at the Palazzo, Leo is a man who means business. And he won&#39;t take &lt;i&gt;no &lt;/i&gt;for an answer...&lt;/p&gt;" />
