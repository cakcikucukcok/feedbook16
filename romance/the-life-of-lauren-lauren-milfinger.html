  <title>The Life of Lauren - Lauren Milfinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Life of Lauren is the erotic autobiography of a kinky, beautiful writer of erotic novels, short stories, and screenplays. She&amp;#39;s experienced cheerleader daisy chains, horny preachers, life in an adults-only nudist colony, worked on porn shoots, loves ocean cruises, the taste of jizz, and can pee standing up. She likes men and women, lives with her&amp;nbsp; brother, and once had a threesome with him and their Aunt Becky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Now the question I have, Lauren, is have you been filled with the spirit?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what you mean. I accepted Jesus, is that it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s part of it. But there&amp;rsquo;s a special anointing, too. Now, this is a big secret, and it&amp;rsquo;s not for everybody. Just special people. People I can see have special qualities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I see.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t, but something was making me a little uneasy about this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He stood up and walked around the desk, standing behind me and putting his hands on my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You see,&amp;rdquo; he continued, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s a gift that&amp;rsquo;s only given to certain ministers. A special gift, bestowed by God Almighty, that allows us to store up divine anointing nectar and deliver it unto the worthy. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to work to attain this gift, of course.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think I might have raised an eyebrow. The school deliberately kept us ignorant about a lot of things, but you could learn a lot outside of school if you knew where to look. I was starting to get a pretty good idea of where he was heading, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help wondering if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen a preview of his special anointing in a copy of Teen Sluts my elder brother kept hidden under his mattress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What would I have to do, exactly?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, as I said, the divine anointing nectar stores itself up in my body. It gathers about my loins, girding them with the Lord&amp;rsquo;s strength and blessing, and when there is someone special, someone deserving of anointing, it strengthens the tower of blessing and shoots forth in holy splendor!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How does this work? I really want to know. I mean, if you think I&amp;rsquo;m worthy of the gift.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My dear,&amp;rdquo; Killjoy replied, &amp;ldquo;you must kiss the tower of blessing. If you are worthy, it will rise and the anointing nectar will burst forth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
What I&amp;rsquo;d thought. He wanted me to suck his cock, the hypocritical bastard. I wondered what was in it for me. He was in his mid-40s, and while he wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I&amp;rsquo;d call ugly, he was hardly the man of my dreams, either. Kind of chunky, with longish brown hair, turning gray.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe. I had a suspicion that most of what was on top was a really expensive hairpiece.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m worthy,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He smiled benignly down over my shoulder. &amp;ldquo;Oh, Lauren, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you are. I can tell.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His right hand slid down from my shoulder and cupped my right boob through my dress. I decided not to say anything yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can feel the spirit in you already,&amp;rdquo; Killjoy continued, kneading my boob.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Didn&amp;rsquo;t feel half bad, to tell the truth. But it was still wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I heard the sound of a zipper by my left ear, and the rustle of cloth. A moment later he&amp;rsquo;d pulled out his cock and flopped it onto my shoulder. I looked over. It was still soft, though it did look to be a respectable size.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Behold,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;the tower of blessing!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You want me to kiss that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Indeed, for the Lord directs.&amp;rdquo;" />
