  <title>Serenity - Kyra E. Gates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I didnt want to fall in love . . . I wanted to run away and I tried too; but every touch just starts a fire within you. Sometimes its like a dream when you think that person wants what you want but youre scared because you dont know; all you know is that, that person makes you feel incredible, desirable; and you find yourself melting . . . and you hope; no you pray that he feels the same way because you dont know if you can walk away . . . you dont want to walk away but you cherish every moment youre with him because if he . . . she doesnt feel the same way at least you . . . .
For as long as Dorian has remembered he has longed for the love of his mother.  His mother is vindictive, heartless and only has one thing on her mind; money and her prestigious position as President of Legacy State University.  Shes thrown women at his feet and disapproved when hes wanted to make his own decisions in regards to his love life and anything else for that matter.   Dorian wants a woman that loves him like no other, a woman he can open his heart too.  A woman that mesmerizes him in and out of the bedroom; and he knows just where to find her.  The woman hes always wanted is now untouchable.  She is the key to his success and the key to his happiness but can he have both?
Serenity Cole is sexy, ambitious, and more often than not confident; but that is until she takes her talents to Legacy State University and finds that the new head coach is none other than Dorian Wilson, the man shes dreamt about since her summer vacations with her family in TC Florida.  
Lines will be crossed, lives will be threatened, love will be tested. Take the ride with Serenity and Dorian as they find something they never thought possible between a man and a woman.
Kyra Gates brings you to tears with her first Romance Novel.  The story of Serenity and Dorian will leave you wanting more.  Its riveting, sexy, and will engulf you like a forest fire." />
