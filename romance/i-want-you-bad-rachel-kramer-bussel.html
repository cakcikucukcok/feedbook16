  <title>I Want You Bad - Rachel Kramer Bussel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Experience the Heights of Passion and the Depths of Desire.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;We&amp;#39;ve all been there&amp;mdash;so taken by a lover that you just can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about him. Your imagination runs wild, fueling your fantasies. You feel hot, feverish, out of control. Your only hope of release is to possess and be possessed. In I Want You Bad, Rachel Kramer Bussel has curated a gloriously explicit collection of riveting romance with an edge. Whether just-blooming passions, rekindled sparks, or reinvented relationships, these lovers put the object of their obsession first. From the almost-divorced couple in &amp;quot;Aftershocks,&amp;quot; by Bella Andre, who finally confess their deepest desires during an earthquake to a woman who tells her boyfriend just how much she lusts after another man in Emerald&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Then,&amp;quot; these lovers push the boundaries of their trust, and are rewarded for taking those risks. Obsessed lovers don&amp;#39;t always do what is rational; sometimes they chase their dreams, as in Kayla Perrin&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;One Night in Paris,&amp;quot; across the world and across the landscape of their lovers&amp;#39; bodies. Lustful and literary, this book asks just how far you&amp;#39;ll go for the man you love." />
