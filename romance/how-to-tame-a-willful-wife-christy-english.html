Don&#39;t get distracted while frisking her for hidden daggers...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anthony Carrington, Earl of Ravensbrook, expects a biddable bride. A man of fiery passion tempted by the rigors of war into steely self-control, he demands obedience from his troops and his future wife. Regardless of how fetching she looks in breeches. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Promised to the Earl of Plump Pockets by her impoverished father, Caroline Montague is no simpering miss. She rides a war stallion named Hercules, fights with a blade, and can best most men with both bow and rifle. She finds Anthony autocratic, domineering, and...ridiculously handsome. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a duel of wit and wills in this charming retelling of &lt;em&gt;The Taming of the Shrew&lt;/em&gt;.
