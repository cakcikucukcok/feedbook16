            &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the processing you have ever experienced was designed to refine the prophetic in you and to propel you into the prophetic promises God preordained from the beginning. Author Jocelyn Y. Buckley provides considerable insight on the prophetic that extends beyond the walls of tradition and into the realm of the supernatural.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through revelatory counsel from God, as it pertains to her own traditional background, Buckley carves into form the mysteries surrounding prophetic operations. The Spirit of God will solve these mysteries in your own prophetic journey as you listen while He speaks. From beginning to end, you will find yourself becoming deeper and deeper &lt;em&gt;Submerged in the Prophetic. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone needs someone to unlock the gift thats in them. Prophetess Jocelyn does just that in her freshman book, helping to unlock the prophetic thats in all of us! Bishop Gregory M. Davis, Television and Radio Host &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Each page is steeped in revelatory truths and permeated with insightful tools for pastors, prophets, and parishioners. Become submerged in a life and ministry enhancing journey in the prophetic! Bishop David C. Cooper, SW Regional Bishop, FGBCFI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
