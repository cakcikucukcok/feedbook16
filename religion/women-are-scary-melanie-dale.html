  <title>Women are Scary - Melanie Dale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip;this is the part where I convince you that you need this book. This book will massage your feet. This book will bring you a fuzzy blanket at the end of a long day of parenting your tiny little insanazoids. I promise to make you snort laugh at least once. After reading this book, you&amp;rsquo;ll rock jazz hands, be able to sing on-key, and never, ever have to fold laundry again. Okay, they told me I&amp;rsquo;m actually supposed to tell you a little about the book. Um, right. Look. Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. Too many of us women are frazzled and lonely, isolated in our minivans while schlepping bags, strollers, and munchkins to and fro across town. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be this way. In this guide to &amp;ldquo;momlationships,&amp;rdquo; I use a dating analogy to take us &amp;ldquo;around the bases&amp;rdquo; to our home-run friendships, the ones that last a lifetime, not just a soccer season. This is our journey to each other, to finding our people and being other people&amp;rsquo;s people, learning how to bless each other and not destroy each other. It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes scary. And always awkward. Let&amp;rsquo;s have some fun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
