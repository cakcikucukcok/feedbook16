  <title>Great Mercy - Michael Cartwright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="GREAT MERCY is a unique series of parables that will speak to the heart of those dissatisfied with time honored denominationalism.
Michael carefully examines through modern parables that church is for the sheep and not the shepherd. 
Michael Cartwright captures the Christian church with an unusual depth of insight into its false longings and purposeful posturing.  Michael sees Jesus leaving a church that has already placed Him behind their backs.
Enjoy a fresh release from the lethargy of ritual as Michaels parables reach into the heart of the weary or war-torn believer.
GREAT MERCY is a parabolic witness to the activity of the unchanging God in His ever-changing world.
Explore the arena that is Christendom and understand the real place of His Son. 
Grasp the human desires of His Bride, while Jesus steps out of the arena to where He is still welcomed.
Finally sip Jesus&#39; new wine for He always leaves the best until last.
Parables included are Stadium Saints, Of Temples &amp; Tombs and Lightning Strikes of Love (and many more)." />
