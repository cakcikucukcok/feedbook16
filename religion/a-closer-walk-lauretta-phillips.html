  <title>A Closer Walk - Lauretta Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I learn more about God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I have a 
closer relationship with God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all I have done, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how could God even want me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not worthy, so why would He care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the questions that prompted&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;the writing of A Closer Walk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come with me as I share this journey from disaster in life to delight in the Lord. Climb aboard as I travel from one signpost to another that leads the way home and shout joyously with me, Abba, Father!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share the laughter and the tears that bring me onto His lap and into the safety of His arms. Climb up there with me, and enjoy the gift of being adopted into the family and heir to the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reach for the wisdom that comes with studying His Word,&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;and learn with me to love again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say with me, Every day in every way, I will walk closer with Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
