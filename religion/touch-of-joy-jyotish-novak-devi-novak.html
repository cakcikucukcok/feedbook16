  <title>Touch of Joy - Jyotish Novak, Devi Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This powerful collection of spiritual writings will change your life by guiding you through inspiration and new perspectives for facing life’s challenges and living a life in joy. Drawing from the teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda (author of the classic Autobiography of a Yogi), “Touch of Joy” shares practical tools, instructive stories, and right attitudes to help you learn to tap the wellsprings of joy within you.
Joy is an aspect of God, and is at the heart of our own soul nature. It is not to be found in outer fulfillments or gratifications, but exists without any cause. Swami Kriyananda, a direct disciple of Yogananda and spiritual teacher of the authors, once said, “Joy is the solution, not the reward.” To learn to live with joy under all circumstances, and not to wait only until conditions are to our liking, is the secret of a happy life.
Jyotish and Devi Novak are celebrated lecturers who have inspired many thousands around the world. They know from experience that these teachings can improve all aspects of life—health, business, success, creativity, marriage, family, education, and spiritual development. The authors, having studied for nearly fifty years with Swami Kriyananda, are Spiritual Directors of Ananda Worldwide and live in Nevada City, California." />
