  <title>Life: Why Live If You Have to Die? - David Alexander Perry Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life: Why Live if You Have to Die? is a unique work that shares principles and illustrations that you may not have thought of. Some of us just live. We take life for granted, and we move according to what we must do or should do. As humans, we have to put up with life because we are here, and we have no choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life to me is like reading a good mystery book. You keep wondering what the next thing will be or how it will end. A problem arises; you solve it. You find joy in attending classes to improve yourself, and it brings excitement and entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is full of poetry, quotations, instructions, and illustrations. Its all about living, and if the living is right, enjoyment, excitement, and fulfilling achievement follows. Life: Why Live if You Have to Die? is written to enlarge your vision about life and to further guide you through the maze and entanglements that life throws at you every day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
