  <title>Peree&#39; and the Magic Fish - Evangelos Tsahiridis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An inspirational story about three old friends and the challenges they overcome. As the three friends set out on a journey to find their fortunes, they must travel all day and into the evening.  Along the way, they talk and laugh and share memories that had long been forgotten.  The sun is nearly setting behind the mountains in the distance when they finally arrive in the city where they plan to find their fortunes.  
One by one, each of the friends discovers the thing that will help them to realize their fortunes.  When the third and last friend, Androkles, discovers his destiny, he is pleased and knows that he will have a good life.  One day he discovers Peree&#39;, a magical figure, who is destined to provide guidance to the one she loves against a tyrannical King. When he is betrayed by someone close to him, she shows him how to master each of the challenges that are presented to him by the King, with the help of her loving family.
Peree&#39; and the Magic Fish is a charming tale of the beauty of true love that illustrates the meaning of goodness and the love of family." />
