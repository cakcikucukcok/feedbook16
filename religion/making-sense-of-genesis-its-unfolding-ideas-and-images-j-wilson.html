  <title>Making Sense of Genesis: Its Unfolding Ideas and Images - J. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Early Genesis is like a table of contents for the rest of the book, a seed from which the rest of Scripture and history unfolds: so many ideas, images, and events can be traced back to it. Like the seeds that are so often our staple for life, Genesis also provides food for the soul, true wisdom, and the big picture we need to live in this world. But its message can be hindered by misunderstanding its purpose.  Making Sense of Genesis looks at what works and what doesn&#39;t work when interpreting Genesis. It&#39;s not a commentary, so it doesn&#39;t interact with all of Genesis or much that has been written about it. Rather, it observes how the ideas and images in early Genesis unfold and are fulfilled, and how they are just as true and fresh for us now as they were in the beginning." />
