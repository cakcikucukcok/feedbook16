  <title>The Testimony - Lee Thomas Cannaday</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Please allow me to walk you through the chapters of this Book . I pray that it may illuminate the eyes of your understanding through the Miracles,Testimonies and Deliverances;concerning Evil spirits that dwell inside the body. The Doctors and psychiatrists call them sickness. Theyprescribe you pills thinking that with these kinds of sicknesses it gives you the cure. However, it doesn&#39;t resolve the matter: The side effects only makes you worse,it only compounds the problem by causing a chemical imbalance of the brain.Your body feeds off of the drug and it becomes dependent on it.It makes you feel like you got to have it and it only makes you sicker and opens the door of your mind for more drugs and more demons to enter.Doctors and psychiatrist call them sickness and diseases.They are still trying to do research on the human body and mind; yethave not found a answer. Theywill not go to the Bible (King James version ) and search the scripture&#39;s for the answers. The Bible says in the book of II Timothy 3:16-17,&quot;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction for instructions in righteousness: That the man of God maybe perfect throughly furnished unto all good works.&quot; Now since I have your undivided attention let us focus onthe miracles, testimonies, and deliverances through your reading. This iswhatbrought me to salvation through Jesus Christ our lord and gave me the in filling of the Holy Ghost and brought me out of the life style of Sin. &lt;/P&gt;" />
