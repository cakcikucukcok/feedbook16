  <title>Where is my Father? - Ii Earnest Edward Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The statistical data regarding the positive and negative of an active father in the lives of his children or the lack thereof is staggering. From everything to how well they do in school to their rate of success in life, their job, to relationships, they all are affected by fatherhood. Further, see appendix, research can prove that many of our youngsters in jail come from fatherless homes. Many suicidal cases are from fatherless homes. Many teenage or unwed pregnancies come from fatherless homes. Even many poverty cases are the direct effects of fatherlessness. &amp;nbsp;And on the flip side, an extreme amount of success cases stem from a fathered household. I believe fathers are the key to building a better community of productive and positive culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this book will be a blessing to sons, fathers, spiritual leaders, wives, mothers and daughters. For, in it contains keen insight on who you are and or dealing with in your life. For instance, if you are a wife, your husband is a son to his father whether the father is alive or not and whether they had a good or bad relationship. What is certain, the relationship has helped to shape and play a very vital role in developing the man or men you see today.&amp;nbsp; This book is a must read from every spectrum of the family and will give everyone a better grasp on how to help heal and or release the power of fatherhood in their respective relationships. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you like me, who grew up predominately without a father, this book will help you discover things about yourself you never thought were there. It will also help bring closure to some things, as well as, a new exciting beginning to you and everyone around you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for new or prospective fathers, this will serve to help equip you in your most glorious role to be. You will see for yourself how important you are to the family unit, according to God and society at large. You will realize how you play a huge part in shaping culture and systems of thought. Fatherhood, in my opinion, is the greatest weapon against darkness or light, good or bad, righteousness or wickedness. It all starts with the father!&lt;/p&gt;" />
