  <title>The Saint Amongst Us - Christine Marketos-Cuomo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Author Christine Marketos-Cuomo is a 30 year career employee of the federal government.  She retired in 2008 from the Bureau of Alchohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Tampa, Florida.   She was producer/director of her own public access television program called &quot;Follow The Sun&quot; for Cox Communications, Pawtucket, Rhode Island and Access Pinellas in Clearwater, Florida where she transferred to in 2001.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Christine is the mother of three children, Rosemaria, Peter and George. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;She is also a very proud grandmother of Alexa, George Jr., and Evangelia (her son George&#39;s three children). She has two daughter-in-laws Taryn and Amy and a son-in-law Thomas that she is also very proud of. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Christine earned an Associate in Science Degree in Paralegal Studies in 1995, and then went on to earn a second Associate in Science Degree in Criminal Justice in 2001 from Fisher College in Boston, Massachusetts. She pursued her goal to obtain these degrees in order to set an example for her children. Today, all of her children are successful professionals in their career choices and they all graduated with honors from Universities in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Florida. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Christine decided to write this book at the time her Uncle, Archbishop Dionysios was alive. It began with a thought that a cook-book of the monk&#39;s diet would benefit today&#39;s health conscious society. The Archbishop provided the recipes that were prepared in the Monastery of Iviron, Greece where he began his monastic life. Prior to finalizing the book, the Archbishop reposed on December 28, 2005. The book was put on hold and Christine decided to write a book about the Archbishop&#39;s life to include the cook-book. Enjoy the book and I promise that you will be inspired by it&#39;s contents.&lt;/P&gt;" />
