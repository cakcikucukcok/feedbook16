  <title>The Spirit Speaks - Cheryl Y. James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Establishing a personal relationship with The Holy Spirit is vital for every Christian and believer in Christ. This is a requirement in order to effectively carry out the will and Word of God to the world at large. It was a pre-requisite for the disciples, before they were allowed to begin their mission work in sharing Christ with the world. The same applies to us. There are many who share and speak Gods Word without the lead of The Holy Spirit. The Question should be: is their mission work considered effective?
The Holy Spirit and power of God, the free gift, the authority, and provider of every need, is our most important and vital need. To receive and resonate power, we must be connected to the power source and supplier of power. It is imperative for every believer to personally know, and recognize the voice of God. In addition, God must be allowed to lead and direct our every move. God should be included in every decision and aspect of our lives, and we should do nothing on our own accord. Do you really know The Lord today? Ask, and it shall be given unto you, seek, and you shall find, knock and the door shall be opened to you! 
...IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE REAL PEACE AND GOOD HEALTH, ESTABLISH THIS RELATIONSHIP &amp; KEEP YOUR MIND ON JESUS.......
