  <title>A Life Worth Living and Loving - Darleen Matherne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a book I had to write; I learned many valuable life lessons while living it and could no longer keep it in. I felt as though God spoke many times to me, directly to my heart and through many others, to tell this story. I never realized I was living anything special that anyone would want to hear until I had so many people tell me to write about it. Little did I know that others were watching in awe and wondering if they could survive the things weve lived through.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If facing adversity with immovable faith in my heart could inspire another person, who am I to not tell my story? How could I be disobedient to what I knew God wanted me to do? I am just an ordinary girl who had no one else to turn to but God. Huntingtons is one of those diseases that causes family members to become devastated and lost because even this world of technology cannot help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Surviving accidents or certain types of trauma are one thing, but to watch the one you love deteriorate to a vegetable state in eighteen years gives a feeling of helplessness. Giving all you have to care for this loved one can also bring a family to physical and emotional devastation. Youve heard of those who have a will to survive. In reading this true story of a family having the husband and father with Huntingtons disease, my hope is that you will be inspired to survive whatever it is you go through or will go through in your life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each time I worked on writing this book, I felt happy and invigorated knowing I was doing what I was supposed to be doing. In reading this book, you can experience every emotion from laughter to crying and many feelings in between. My hope is that this book will inspire you to not give up on your dreams, to live, to love, and to know God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
