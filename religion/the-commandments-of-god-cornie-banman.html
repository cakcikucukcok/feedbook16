  <title>The Commandments of God - Cornie Banman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As parents, we want the best for our children. We want them to succeed in every area of their lives, which often requires that we provide rules and boundaries so that no harm comes to them. In the same way, God creates spiritual boundaries and laws for His children so that we may be successful in our walk with Him. But what happens when His children, like our children, rebel and decide to break the rules they have been given? 
In The Commandments of God, author Cornie Banman revisits the laws and commandments that God created for His children and addresses the question many twenty-first century Christians ask: are the Ten Commandments and other Scriptural laws still applicable to our lives today? Banman examines how the Messiah and His first followers responded to this rebellious attitude and how todays traditional religious society responds to these commandments. He also explores how Satan, the great deceiver, continues to deceive us about Gods laws and plans for our lives.
The Commandments of God seeks to provide answers to questions that have plagued Christians since the beginning of the Christian faith, allowing a better understanding of Gods plan for our lives." />
