  <title>Tell the World - Myra Waverly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever had the feeling there was something you had to do? Something that starts being on your mind just about every day and soon after every minute of the day? This is how I felt for months. &quot;Something&quot;, &quot;Someone&quot; wanted me to write and Tell the World. &quot;It/He/They&quot; showed me very clearly what to do (&quot;Tell the World&quot;). Left at a loss about what I was to &quot;tell&quot;, I just started writing hoping things would become clearer soon. This is my story. The story of a Muslim raised girl growing up in France in humility and surrounded by family love, until faith crashed against emotions and unleashed an unexpected reaction to my life desires. Everything happens for a reason though and the chain of events that followed (and brought me to the United States) made me the person I am today. My book shares with the world what I faced and attempts to contrast the faith I thought I knew with what Salvation brought to my life. My confusion and uncertainty lead to a quest for truth and answers I never imagined." />
