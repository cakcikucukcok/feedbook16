  <title>Bitter, Broken, Blessed - Nora Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life contains intense battles. When it has been infiltrated by heartache, suffering, and evil how does one move past it and leave the trauma behind? When our faith and belief clash with reality and crush us between the two, how in the world does one survive the force?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitter, Broken, Blessed is the true story of a woman caught in such circumstances. Facing enemy forces that she does not understand, her desire is to be strong and steadfast in her faith. When her resolve weakens and strength eludes her, how does she continue on the journey? When life becomes devastating and full of destruction, can she survive? Can she be put back together after hitting bottom and shattering, crashing so hard there is little hope for survival?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life can get quite overwhelming at times. Many of us manage to trudge through and arrive on the other side of our trials, battered but not completely broken. Somehow, we manage to find the courage and stamina to get up and keep going. Some of us struggle with our faith in the process, and we cannot grasp the concept of how everything that happens works together for good and the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resilient spirit of mankind is incredible, and our design is quite unique; this is because God does exist, and He is the Divine Creator. All things are possible through Him, even deliverance from the most horrific events and darkest corners of existence. There is unmitigated power in the cross of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
