  <title>Passing Through the World - Amin George Forji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Forji has the magical knack of showing the world as it appears through the eyes of a young person.  His words first introduce the reader to Cameroons diverse society as an infant sees it; and then we peer with him through the anxious lens of adolescence. Forjis is an authentic Cameroonian voice that helps the reader understand how things were for a youngster in his country in the 1980s and 1990s.
Claire George PhD
Stunning and unique not just for the unconventional storyline but also the ingenuity with which Forji tells it.  an interesting read that chronicles life in a typical African setting as well as the complexities of polygamous family circles.
Dr. Edinam K. Glover, University of Helsinki
   A prosaic masterpiece packed with memorable events. an illuminating African story.
Tchoumi Leopold, Author of Des Amours Sans Papiers
A story of a childhood with many highs, many lows and many challenges in between, a type of childhood many of us experience.  This is Forji&#39;s story of how these highs, lows and challenges helped shape him into the man he is today.
