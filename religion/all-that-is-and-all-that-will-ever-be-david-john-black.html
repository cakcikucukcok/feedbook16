      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a world where we are drowning in information and yet starving for wisdom, every now and then someone comes along who understands Life so well, that theyre able to explain it simply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad things dont happen to us because we are bad. Its not like we are being punished. All That Is is for anyone who has ever wondered who we truly are, why we are here and what were meant to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a series of light bulb moments, this intriguing compilation of insightful oneliners contains 101 lifechanging sayings which explore the timeless truths of being human. It can help adults of all ages and all cultures to live our best possible life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are genuine in wanting greater peace of mind, more joy and happiness, easy-going relationships, improved health, better finances and ultimately, being at One with All of Life, then this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ponder, contemplate or reflect upon these seemingly intuitive wisdoms which most people dont even slow down enough to notice, much less reflect upon. Then make them a part of your daily life to internalize the learnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All That Is is a little tome that can last a person a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read All That Is in two minutes, or you can meditate on each of its sentences for a whole lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
