  <title>I Never Came Home - Robert  L. Scheck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you aware of the hour we are in? This 21st Century has been dubbed the &amp;ldquo;Age of Information.&amp;rdquo; Our world today is inundated with a sea of information, yet could we still be lacking wisdom? We claim information and knowledge are power, so, why then do nations still fall into the same critical mistakes, generation after generation, regarding being powerless in preventing wars, global terrorism or even natural disasters? Now is the hour to seek our Creator and pray for this quandary. This is the true personal wartime story of a soldier, the author, experiencing first hand how the war in Vietnam affected him, spirit, soul and body. The author offers an inside-the-mind perception of a typical, young &amp;ldquo;baby boomer&amp;rdquo; soldier facing this dilemma during his 14-month tour in northern Vietnam. Confronting this historic event, he explains the traumatic episodes of his personal war, his transparent thoughts, and how wartime clearly affected his life, the marriage and family he left behind, and his future. Scheck uses humor to soften the seriousness of the subject matter and shines a revelation upon those personally involved in today&amp;rsquo;s global war with terrorism, the emotional and physical health issues that continue to linger on. This treatise offers the reader therapy and understanding of the returning soldiers and their desperate need for healing of the spirit, soul and body. &amp;ldquo;War isn&amp;rsquo;t over when it&amp;rsquo;s over!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
