  <title>Who Is Your Master? - Larry Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the secret sins that many Christians and non-Christians alike are harboring. There are many pastors, ministers, and lay members who struggle with this problem and are too embarrassed and ashamed and have no one to go to in confidence to seek help. I am transparent about how I got hooked and how God delivered me. There are women that are in this situation, so it is not a man thing. This secret sin has destroyed ministries and marriages. I want to help people get free. It has been reported that when church conferences come to a city, the porn rental increases. I am available for one-on-one and group sessions. God wants to bring you out of darkness into his marvelous light. This is not every man or womans battle, but it is every man and womans victory." />
