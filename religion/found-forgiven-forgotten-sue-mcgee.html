  <title>Found, Forgiven, Forgotten - Sue McGee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MAZE OF CONFUSION
Lost in a maze of confusion and desperation, suicide seemed to be the only solution. I had a life of chaos spent searching for my purpose in life. My search including a God I knew was there but did not know how to seek Him. Was He really there, and if so, why couldn&#39;t I find Him? Many songs came out during the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s that described me perfectly. Some of the words were; How do I get off from this merry-go-round, my head is spinning, lonely girl, caught in this game, lost as a lamb, and who am I? I cried every time I heard these songs because I could relate to them all. I knew I was caught in a web of despair but did not know how to become free or find hope by trying to find my way out of the maze alone.  God sent a light from above through a dream He gave me that  I believe was the hand of an angel. She took me by the had and helped to guide me through the maze to a path that began to bring me peace and hope.  I followed her in my dream to a pathway that was leading me to God. She said, do not be afraid. God loves, God cares, God hears. From there I  became involved in Bible Studies, support groups and church meetings. He sent wonderful people to me that helped me grow as a Christian woman.  He has used my past over and over again during the past thirty-five years to help others find HOPE and peace in a dark and confusing world. My siblings and I were raised in a dysfunctional home where there was addiction, abuse, alcoholism, incest, homosexuality, molestation, adultery, anger, and oppression. He took our lives and recreated us and made something beautiful of our lives. Why? Because He is real. HE LIVES! There is hope, we just have to want it. H-Hope O-Offers- P-Promises- E- Everyday. HOPE also Opens Painful Eyes so we can truly see the wonderful plans He has for all of us no matter what our past was like." />
