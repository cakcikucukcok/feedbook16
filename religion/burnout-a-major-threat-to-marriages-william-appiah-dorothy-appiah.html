Some spouses complain of being stressed in their marriage and complain continuously without much attention from their partners. But they are not alone.

Some find themselves in a hopeless situation because they genuinely do not know what to do to rekindle their marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book, &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Burn-out: A Major Threat To&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Marriages,&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; is written to inform and educate Christian couples about the reality of marital burnout. It provides the necessary information to help people who are tired in the marriage. The book stresses the importance of communication with emphasis on listening.
