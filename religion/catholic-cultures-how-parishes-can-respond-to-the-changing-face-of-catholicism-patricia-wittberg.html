  <title>Catholic Cultures: How Parishes Can Respond to the Changing Face of Catholicism - Patricia Wittberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;From its earliest days, Christianity has been lived and proclaimed in the language and symbols of each receiving culture. Today, these cultures include the new ethnic groups moving into our parishes. They also include new generations of Catholic young adults, whose childhood experiences of their faith are very different from those of their elders. In &lt;I&gt;Catholic Cultures&lt;/I&gt;, Sister Patricia Wittberg offers a view of Catholicism through the eyes of Catholics from these different cultures, so that we may all be challenged to grow in our reception of the Good News.&amp;#160;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This book is an ideal resource for parish ministers, educators, and parents struggling with how to evangelize and minister to unfamiliar cultures. It is also a tool for leaders trying to build a strong community made up of members who represent a variety of ethnic backgrounds and ages.&lt;/div&gt;" />
