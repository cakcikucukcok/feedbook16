  <title>A Biblical Approach to Racism - Michael Cromwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This is a book of hope; hope for the future and hope for the present. I have seen a cancer in American society grow over the years and I felt the need to address it in the most powerful manner possible, through God.&lt;P&gt;  Race relations and racism in my opinion are in a state of regression in the United States. I see and hear things as an American black these days that I never thought I would see and hear in my lifetime. I sense an uneasy calm between the races that does not need to be there, held in place only by the vague concept of political correctness. But the heart is still active and no one knows how it will act next.&lt;P&gt;  In addressing racism, in this brief work, I redefine it, explain why it is here and offer solutions for its eradication. I require a trust form the reader and a partnership. Self-less trust is one of the most fundamentally lacking elements in American society today and this is what I request from the reader.&lt;P&gt;  The inclination to discriminate because of race comes from a number of sources. I have identified pride, ignorance, fear, jealousy and hatred as some of the key motivations. I have sought to quell these negative emotions through the Bible and in solving these emotions, solve the actions they lead to, including racism.&lt;P&gt;Next I seek to explain, through the Bible, how racism came into being and why it continues to be; then I discuss the victim and racism, what the victim experiences; next I seek to show, still through Bible scripture, how we can curb our worst natures through the Bible; lastly I show how solving racism can lead to solutions to other problems both here in America and in the world.&lt;P&gt;  To make this all happen I must have the readers trust and courage.&lt;P&gt;  Solving racism is an easy task. It takes only a shedding of self. Selfishness is the biggest obstacle to cooperation and unity.&lt;/P&gt;" />
