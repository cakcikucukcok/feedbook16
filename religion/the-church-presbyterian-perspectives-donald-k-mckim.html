  <title>The Church: Presbyterian Perspectives - Donald K. McKim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book considers basics of Christian faith about the church, conveyed through the perspectives of the Reformed tradition, particularly in its Presbyterian expression from Donald McKim&#39;s own context in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).   The six chapters deal with ecclesiology: understandings of the church. The book begins by considering the call to follow Jesus in the church, the beginning of the Christian journey. The Reformation slogan &quot;the Church Reformed and Always Being Reformed according to the Word of God&quot; orients us to the nature of the church and God&#39;s ongoing work of Word and Spirit within the community of faith.   Three of the chapters discuss phrases from the Apostles&#39; Creed. These are &quot;I believe in the Holy Spirit,&quot; &quot;the holy catholic church,&quot; and &quot;the communion of saints.&quot; The final chapter, called &quot;Imagine the Church!&quot; provides theological resources for helping us recognize and experience the God of superabundance who is at work in the world, in the church, and in our own lives (Eph 3:20).   Together these essays provide theological understandings of the church while also exploring the meanings and implications of the church for Christian life and experience today." />

    	<p>This book considers basics of Christian faith about the church, conveyed through the perspectives of the Reformed tradition, particularly in its Presbyterian expression from Donald McKim's own context in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).   The six chapters deal with ecclesiology: understandings of the church. The book begins by considering the call to follow Jesus in the church, the beginning of the Christian journey. The Reformation slogan "the Church Reformed and Always Being Reformed according to the Word of God" orients us to the nature of the church and God's ongoing work of Word and Spirit within the community of faith.   Three of the chapters discuss phrases from the Apostles' Creed. These are "I believe in the Holy Spirit," "the holy catholic church," and "the communion of saints." The final chapter, called "Imagine the Church!" provides theological resources for helping us recognize and experience the God of superabundance who is at work in the world, in the church, and in our own lives (Eph 3:20).   Together these essays provide theological understandings of the church while also exploring the meanings and implications of the church for Christian life and experience today.</p>
