  <title>Drama Tweens: Engaging the Bible with Younger Adolescents - Katherine Turpin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Because of their ever-changing personalities, their high energy, and their emerging ability to think critically, younger adolescents present a special faith formation challenge to the congregations who love them. This book explores an educational strategy of creating biblical dramas with tweens for spiritual formation and increased familiarity with the Christian tradition. The project of creating a drama for presentation to the congregation invites tweens to dig into the history of interpretation of the story, to make connections across the biblical text, and to engage with the characters in relevant ways to their own experiences. Writing and producing a small play in worship allows them to share their learnings with the rest of their faith community. The book helps prepare adult volunteers to better understand the transformations happening in the late elementary and middle school years and to lead tweens through this process with confidence. Five sample plays, all co-written and performed by the tweens of Christ Church United Methodist in Denver, Colorado, are also included. These slightly snarky but fearlessly faithful interpretations model the kind of depth engagement with biblical stories that the Drama Tweens process hopes to create." />
