  <title>The Adventures of Cancer Girl and God - Anna Fitch Courie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• Popular health and fitness author/nurse
• First-hand experience living with cancer in 30+ &quot;days of journaling&quot; through the course of a year
• Help for Christians struggling with health and illness who want to connect spiritual beliefs to their whole life, including the illness experience, and to see purpose in their illness journey
Cancer diagnosis and treatment can make a person feel both frightened and powerless; Anna Fitch Courie takes a different approach: Join her as she embarks on an epic journey with God after finding out she has cancer. Cancer Girl wraps herself in a cape of grace, freely sharing her experiences of diagnosis, traversing the medical system, finding faith in God again, and learning to live with cancer. Cancer Girl learns that there is no stronger “magic word” than “Trust God.”  
Part journal, part sage advice, Fitch Courie weaves her experience as a nurse throughout her story.  Using her real-time blog posts during the course of diagnosis, treatment, and living with the disease, Fitch Courie covers the cycle of grief and relearning a new norm, offering assurance to others that they are not alone. 
Each chapter opens with Scripture that reflects the theme of the day. Section 1 covers early stages of the journey; Section 2 offers learnings from the experience; and Section 3 offers questions for the individual to reflect on their own illness and how they felt. Readers are encouraged to explore their thoughts, feelings, and experiences with their illness in order to contribute to overall healing." />
