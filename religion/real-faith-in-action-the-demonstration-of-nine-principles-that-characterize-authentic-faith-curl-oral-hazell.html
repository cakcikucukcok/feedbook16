  <title>Real Faith in Action: The Demonstration of Nine Principles that Characterize Authentic Faith - Curl Oral Hazell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this day of increasing uncertainty and fear, faith in God is needed more than ever before. In addition to its incalculable other benefits, faith in God brings peace, comfort, and overflowing joy to those who put their trust in God. But not any kind of faith can procure these benefits, only biblical faith can. When understood in its biblical authenticity, and then put into action, faith always leads to triumph in that it enables us to experience what God ordained for us to obtain, perform, and become. In light of this, it is extremely important that we--the people of God--possess a comprehensive, biblically-based, practical tool to aid us in achieving this understanding. Real Faith in Action is that tool! It presents an unconventional, multi-dimensional view of faith, revealing many aspects usually not discussed in other works, through nine principles that are clearly laid out by the Holy Spirit in what is unquestionably the most comprehensive reporting of the working of faith in all of Scripture--the roll call of faith in Hebrews 11. The principles are thus illustrated through the real life experiences of fellow humans who dared to believe God for the impossible. Accordingly, the book goes beyond explaining faith to demonstrating faith. It is designed to captivate and draw the reader into the world of the faith heroes of the past, thus inspiring him or her to do likewise. Furthermore, in that real life experiences are discussed, any thought of being incapable of doing the same should be vanquished, knowing that others succeeded in their accomplishments by utilizing the same faith to which we also have access." />
