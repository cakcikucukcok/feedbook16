  <title>Connecting Trails - Sean Jungo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nature can provide us with a way of reframing our minds, and dwelling in Gods creation can offer us a space to see, hear, and walk clearly. This clear thinking is what allows us to walk in harmony with the earth and with God, and as we traverse the paths and trails of nature, we can learn more about ourselves and our own personal journeys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Connecting Trails: The Window of Life, author and naturalist Sean Jungo invites you to join him on his own journey through hundreds of miles of trails in our great National Park system. You will go off the beaten path to some of the most seldom-visited spots in America, and as you follow Seans journey, you will discover that each story has a unique lesson that provides a small piece of the greater puzzle. As each piece is laid down, you have the opportunity to think about your own life and what you can learn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature provides the setting for great reflections into the human drumbeat and Gods will for our lives. As we learn about the rhythms and seasons of nature, we learn bits of wisdom we can use to build more fulfilling lives. And no matter where you are on this great journey we call life, relishing in Seans experience of nature can offer a renewed desire to reflect and steadily build your own connecting trails.&lt;/p&gt;" />
