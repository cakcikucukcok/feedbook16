  <title>Jenny - Jane Waters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jenny is the story of a sweet and bright eleven-year-old girl who has had to grow up too quickly.  Her birth mother, Natasha, a single, drug-addicted parent, had five children by different men who have abandoned her.  The effects of drug abuse on Natasha had opened a vacancy in the home for the position of &quot;mother.&quot;  The only willing applicant had been Jenny who stepped into the role of managing to care for her younger siblings when her mother was out.  A tragic series of events leads to the inevitable decision of removing the children from Natasha and placing them with a loving, young couple who eventually adopted all of them when Jenny was six.  Jenny continually finds it challenging to trust anyone.Haunted by her perceived responsibility of protecting her siblings, Jenny encounters a series of twists and turns in her teenage years that keep triggering her issues of anger and unforgiveness towards her birth mother and places her at risk for repeating Natasha&#39;s mistakes.  However, Jenny discovers that God, who has a plan for Jenny, and open adoption are the keys for healing." />
