  <title>Listen to My Heart - Katrina Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Listen to My Heart Speak is a compilation of poetic letters written by writers from different walks of life. Candidly and vividly, lyricists open their hearts on paper, describing the metamorphosis of a sometimes ailing soul as it goes through renewal until a fully delivered spirit is born. Feelings, desires, and beliefs are poetically exhaled as the process of writing brings forth hope, victory, and deliverance. This is the psalm of our generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is written to encourage and to liberate those who know our struggle because it is or has been their struggle. Its written to empower people who are bottled up but cant put their feelings into words that so desperately need to be released. Its written for all lovers of poetry that can appreciate and dance to the beat of our hearts as we reveal our life experiences in words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are times when we were afraid and times when we were boldly confident. Read it and see for yourselves how poetically we have written our way to freedom. It has been a remarkable journey in which weve grown, and still, our best is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;" />
