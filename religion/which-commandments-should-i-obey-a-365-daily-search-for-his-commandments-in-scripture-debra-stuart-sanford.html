      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered, &quot;What commandments should I obey?&quot; Our Messiah said in John 14:15, &quot;If you love me, you will keep my commandments.&quot; What commandments was He talking about? The ones He taught His disciples? The 10 commandments? Are there other commandments that I should obey? There is much debate over which commandments to keep today.

If your life begins to bear fruit because you are keeping this commandment, then you have found life and Truth. As you begin your search for Truth, this book can be the beginning of your journey.

These letters are written in third person from Father&#39;s point of view. It is Debra&#39;s fervent prayer that all readers will be blessed as she has been blessed from these letters.
