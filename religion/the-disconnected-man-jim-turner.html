  <title>The Disconnected Man - Jim Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;THE DISCONNECTED MAN tracks the journey of one man&#39;s surprise discovery of his own disconnectedness and his desire to help other men, and the women who love them, before it is too late. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;Disconnected men hide out in plain view: in our churches, in our families and in our communities. They are competent, capable men who quietly &#39;do their duty&#39; and attract little attention. They are fairly happy guys, relatively unemotional and capable of carrying heavy loads of responsibility, but are very difficult to get to know beyond superficial friendship. A closer examination inside their marriages reveals a desert strewn with emotionally emaciated spouses. While their competence may build the church, organize a group, or run a company, they haven&#39;t the slightest notion how to connect intimately with those they love. Their wives suffer, usually in silence, while the church and culture press past this couple secretly falling apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jim Turner was that disconnected man going about his life, happily fulfilling his duty within his own self-protective bubble, until God suddenly burst it in a most horrific way. His story starts when that devastation left him clinging precariously to the remaining shreds of his broken marriage. Jim longs to share with other disconnected men what he learned through that ordeal, to help them understand their disobedience and show how they can achieve real connection with those they love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
