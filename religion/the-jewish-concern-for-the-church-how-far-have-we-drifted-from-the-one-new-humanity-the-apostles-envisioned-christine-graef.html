  <title>The Jewish Concern for the Church: How Far Have We Drifted from the One New Humanity the Apostles Envisioned? - Christine Graef</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The voices of Messianic rabbis and believers have been collected in this volume to share concerns about the gap that remains between Jews and the church. For the past fifteen centuries, the church has been predominantly Gentile. Jews of faith were not considered Jews, but as &quot;converted.&quot; Today, as Messianic congregations multiply and church denominations try to find their way back to the original principles of the early church, the church is challenged to repair this relationship, deepen its understanding of the apostles&#39; vision of one new man, and be edified by the meaning in appointed observances that extended to graft in the wild olive branches. &quot;For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility&quot; (Eph 2:14)." />
