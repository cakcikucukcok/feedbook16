  <title>Searching for Sacred Space: Essays on Architecture and Liturgical Design in the Episcopal Church - John Ander Runkle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every Sunday we walk through those (probably red) doors and enter a sacred space. It is familiar . . . maybe comforting . . . maybe not . . . maybe downright uncomfortable and unwelcoming.  In twelve thoughtful and provocative essays, the writers ask important questions about the relationship between sacred spaces and the worship that takes place in them:  -How do our buildings convey a vision of God&#39;s kingdom on earth? -How are our places of worship reflecting our beliefs? -In what visible, tangible forms are we proclaiming a faith in the living God? -How are our church buildings helping this church bring the Gospel into a new century?" />
