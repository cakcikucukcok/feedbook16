  <title>God Has Purpose for You - Kerwin D. Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you feel purposeless? Do you go through the day half-awake, wondering what youre working forwhat youre living for? Youre not alone. This is a common symptom of many Christians, despite a strong faith in God and His word. We know what we are supposed to believe and how we are supposed to live; so why is that biblically inspired peace, joy, and love so hard to come by?
You dont have to ask yourself these questions anymore. &lt;i&gt;God Has a Purpose for You&lt;/i&gt; is an enlightening and invigorating look at the Bible and how it proves we each have a specific purpose, set forth for us by the Lord. Kerwin Tucker describes many different steps along the path to finding your lifes purpose, including The Prerequisites for Living a Spirit-Led Life, Define Your Vision, and The Pathway to Your Destiny.
Its easy to believe you will never do anything substantial with your life. Its easy to think it would be impossible to have a lasting effect on your friends, family, and neighbors  but its not true. God has put you here for a reason. You have a predestined purpose, and it is finally time to take a step in the right direction. Find your life purpose, through Christ, and in so doing, discover sought after peace and ever-present joy." />
