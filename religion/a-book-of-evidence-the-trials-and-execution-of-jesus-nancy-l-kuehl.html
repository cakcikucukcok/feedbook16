  <title>A Book of Evidence: The Trials and Execution of Jesus - Nancy L. Kuehl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jesus was a Jew, living in a Jewish culture and under Jewish laws, laws that governed the people of Israel at a time of conflict with their Roman overlords. A Book of Evidence takes into consideration the history of first-century Jerusalem and is a unique presentation of the passion event, written from a Jewish legal standpoint. Find out why and how Jesus came to trial, how the politics of the age and a corrupt government played a role in bringing him to death. An examination of the numerous crimes of which Jesus was accused results in a reasonable explanation of the real blasphemy that caused him to be executed, and an investigation into crucifixion as it was known during first-century Jewish law. Was the Jewish trial legal? Was it a trial at all? Was there a Roman trial or a simple hearing? Where was the real execution site and burial tomb? All these questions are answered in this gripping book. Follow, step by step, along the path of Jesus during the Passover, from the Garden of Gethsemane, through the trials, to the brutality of the execution, and on to the garden tomb at Bethphage from which he was resurrected!" />
