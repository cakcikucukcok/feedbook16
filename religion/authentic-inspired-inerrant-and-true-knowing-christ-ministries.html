  <title>Authentic, Inspired, Inerrant and True - Knowing Christ Ministries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=justify&gt;From the beginning of time Satan has attempted to make us question God&#39;s Holy Word. Part of Satan&#39;s plan is to prevent us from believing in the accuracy, inerrancy, truth and inspired nature of God&#39;s Word. It&#39;s easier to look at The Bible as a story book or piece of literature rather than know the Word of God is true. Thus many people think of the Bible as a story book or a book of historical literature - therefore whether it is true or not is immaterial. Many people say they believe in some parts and not others. We know that the Bible is the true, inspired and inerrant, accurate Word of God, if part is true, all is true. If it is all true we must face the truth about our moral character.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Thus, through independent research and with the goal of Scripture proving Scripture rather than relying on what man says about Scripture, this book gradually came together exploring such topics as:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIR&gt;
&lt;DIR&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt; What God Says&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt; Statistical Proof&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt; Historical and Archeological Evidence&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt; Prophecy&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIR&gt;&lt;/DIR&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;And finally a look at how the various versions of The Bible came about and a candid discussion of how accurate or inaccurate they are.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Let Dr. West-Stellick lead you on an exciting journey that lays the foundation and then covers 3,500 years of writing, translations, discoveries and more. Authentic, Inspired, Inerrant and True will bring you to the fact based conclusion - The Bible &lt;I&gt;is&lt;/I&gt; God&#39;s Word to us.&lt;/P&gt;
