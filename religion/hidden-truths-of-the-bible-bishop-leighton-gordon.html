  <title>Hidden Truths of the Bible - Bishop Leighton Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you desire to know the truth?
There are a lot of misconceptions about the Bible.  Lies are often passed down from generation to generation, manipulating the word of God.  The only way to really and truly gain a full understanding of the Bible is by intensely studying it with great aspiration.  Some may be fine with not knowing the complete truth, or pretending to be a sold out Christian, and not honestly knowing what Gods word says about many issues faced on a daily basis.  Individuals may be fine displaying that tag that reads, Jesus is my co-pilot on the front of their car.  In all reality, Jesus is the pilot; he operates the vehicle that drives us though life.  Most of us are driving underage and need some parental guidance.  God is our father and wants to keep us on the right path by nurturing us with his unique and supernatural word, The Bible.
Jesus gives us the freedom to run to him or away from him.  
Hidden Truths challenges you to consider the truth and what it entails.  Leighton directly approaches the truth in a daring way that reveals Jesus love for you and causes you to re-evaluate your relationship with Jesus.  Leighton urges you to redevelop principles that you have been practicing the wrong way.  The only right way to do things is by following Gods holy word." />
