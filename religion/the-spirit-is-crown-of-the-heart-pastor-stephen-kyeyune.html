  <title>The Spirit Is Crown of the Heart - Pastor Stephen Kyeyune</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In case you asked me the most important topic in this book I would answer that the topic about praying. This book positions you to present your prayers directly to God with confidence that your prayers are received by God rather than sending your prayer request to a clergyman. Everything inside this book will equally benefit the reader. You do not want to miss my teaching on how to be baptized, filled and led by the Holy Spirit; also how to overcome temptation and biblical illiteracy. Gods assignment to the Church: the gifts and ministries of the Holy Spirit. In the last chapter of my book, I give my emotional testimony regarding the terrors of the murderous regime of Idi Amin and how God saved me and how He taught me practically to forgive. Learn the necessity of forgiveness.
I decided to dedicate this book to my beloved dad, the late Israel Kyeyune, my beloved mother Milly Muganzi, and the Church (body of Christ). The cry of my heart is for the unified body of Christ. Christ is coming for the Church without color and wrinkle. I believe that the wrinkle of division must be ironed out of our fabric before we think about meeting our Bridegroom. The answer is found within the spiritual mutuality of all believers.  
Special thanks go to my family in particular my wife and my love Elizabeth Kyeyune. I want to thank also those people who have been of such great encouragement to me in different ways in particular the Multicultural Family Fellowship in South Bend where I am the pastor. God bless." />
