  <title>Graces: Prayers for Everyday Meals and Special Occasions - June Cotner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Saying grace at mealtime is a time-honored tradition for many families and a newfound source of spiritual connection for others. Whether you&#39;re a master at giving the blessing or fairly new to this sacred art, Graces will bring inspiration to your meals and special gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the need for such inspiration at her family&#39;s table, June Cotner compiled a notebook of poems, prayers, and songs that she solicited from friends, strangers, family members, and ministers. She has turned her family&#39;s well-worn notebook into this elegantly packaged edition, which will complement your finest table settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arranged by thirteen themes, this beautiful gift book contains poems, prayers, songs, invocations, and salutations by figures as diverse as Leunig and Browning, Emerson and Starhawk, Kahlil Gibran and Schweitzer. Whether you need a Sanskirt Salutation to the Dawn, a Gaelic Blessings, or ancient Chinese Prayer,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Graces&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;offers fitting words for every occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a collection of original, traditional, and multicultural blessings makes it easy to share wisdom and insight with family and friends before meals or at special gatherings. The graces compiled here have been used by people of all religions beliefs, and special attention was given to how easily the words can be spoken by both adults and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life if full of occasions when it seems appropriate to say grace.&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Graces&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;contains 133 prayers, poems, and blessings that span the centuries and draw from many traditions. Bring spiritual focus to your meals by bringing&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Graces&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;to your table.&lt;/p&gt;" />
