  <title>Growing in the Presence of God - Calvin W. Allison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We take the journey together. Jesus leads the way and we follow. We travel the narrow road and go through the process of spiritual growth. Our tests arent always easy. It takes a lot of study and dedication to make the grade, to show ourselves approved unto God. But we endure. We continue down the narrow road, keeping our eyes on the One that leads our hearts in the right direction.
The worlds distractions are there, opening their doors of pleasure, in hopes of leading us astray and pulling us back into their grip of deception. But we are not of those that depart from the way. We are the strong and the faithful. We, through great adversity, pass the tests that are set before us. We are growing, becoming more and more like our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
Growing in the Presence of God is the fifth book by author Calvin W. Allison. Its theme is on spiritual growth. Its intended to encourage believers to prepare themselves for tough times. To diligently seek God and to study His word. Because the process of spiritual growth will take the believer through some tough times. And good preparation is extremely important.
With poetry, teachings, testimonies, and scripture, this book has much to offer." />
