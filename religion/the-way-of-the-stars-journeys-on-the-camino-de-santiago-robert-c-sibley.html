  <title>The Way of the Stars: Journeys on the Camino de Santiago - Robert C. Sibley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since medieval times, pilgrimages have been a popular religious or     spiritual undertaking. Even today, between seventy and one hundred million people a year make     pilgrimages, if not for expressly religious reasons, then for an alternative to secular goals     and the preoccupation with consumption and entertainment characteristic of contemporary life. In     &lt;i&gt;The Way of the Stars,&lt;/i&gt; the journalist Robert Sibley, motivated at least in     part by his own sense of discontent, recounts his walks on one of the most well-known     pilgrimages in the Western world-the Camino de Santiago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A medieval route that     crosses northern Spain and leads to the town of Santiago de Compostela, the Camino has for     hundreds of years provided for pilgrims the practice, the place, and the circumstances that     allow for spiritual rejuvenation, reflection, and introspection. Sibley, who made the     five-hundred-mile trek twice-initially on his own, and then eight years later with his     son-offers a personal narrative not only of the outward journey of a pilgrim&#39;s experience     on the road to Santiago but also of the inward journey afforded by an interlude of solitude and     a respite from the daily demands of ordinary life. The month-long trip put the author on a path     through his own memories, dreams, and self-perceptions as well as through the sights and sounds,     the tastes and sensations, of the Camino itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
