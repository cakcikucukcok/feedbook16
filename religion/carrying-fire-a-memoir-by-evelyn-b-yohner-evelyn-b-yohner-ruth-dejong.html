  <title>Carrying Fire: A Memoir by Evelyn B. Yohner - Evelyn B. Yohner, Ruth DeJong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The era of narratives in which missionaries followed God&amp;rsquo;s calling to remotest lands are necessarily dwindling away as a new generation of missionaries stands on the shoulders of these pioneers, and technology redefines how missionary endeavor is accomplished. These stories are like rare pearls, collected from a way of &amp;ldquo;doing&amp;rdquo; missions no longer done, when intrepid men and women sacrificed everything to obey God&amp;rsquo;s voice. Such is the story of Art and Evy Yohner.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Evy shares the wonder, joy, and heartaches of their journey as they followed God&amp;rsquo;s call to &amp;ldquo;carry their fire,&amp;rdquo; their passion for God and the lost, to Suriname, South America, to find and take the Gospel to the lost tribe of Akuriyos, and ultimately to an international ministry of teaching, encouragement, and support to other missionaries. Evy details the struggles and humor of adapting to life in the jungle, a new culture, and raising their young daughter, while making expeditions deep into the jungle in search of the Akuriyos. Through Art&amp;rsquo;s gift of photography, they capture their love for the people God had called them to seek out in His name. Their experiences in the jungle serve as the &amp;ldquo;proving ground&amp;rdquo; for the ministry to which God would later call Art &amp;amp; Evy, carrying the fire of their passion for Him for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Evy&amp;rsquo;s narrative is a loving dedication to her dear Art, and a tribute to God&amp;rsquo;s love, power, and provision, as well as a moment in history in which humble people did humble things to the glory of God.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evy Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Evy Yohner grew up in West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland, meeting her future husband, Art, when her family lived at Aberdeen Proving Ground. Receiving Christ as Savior soon after marrying, Art and Evy felt the call of God to commit their lives to serving Him: &amp;ldquo;Lord, Anything, Anytime, Anywhere, at Any Cost.&amp;rdquo; Their commitment and passion for God took them to full time service in Suriname, South America, and then to minister internationally with World Team, and eventually begin Art Yohner Missions Ministries (AYMMI).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Evy is now retired and lives in Bradenton, FL, less than a mile from her daughter, Ruthi, and her family, and is a great-grandmother of four. She originally began writing her story for her grandchildren, but her many friends encouraged her to collect and share her adventures. She maintains a ministry of encouragement and counsel, and continues to write and share her insights gleaned from a lifetime of commitment to God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
