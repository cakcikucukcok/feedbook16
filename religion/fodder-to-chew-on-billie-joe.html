  <title>Fodder    	To Chew On - Billie Joe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FODDER TO CHEW ON, Book Two, offers a bold, factual look at some controversial and seldom discussed Bible topics.  Some are:
Was the woman at the well a prostitute no man could satisfy?  (Some say so.)
Was God a good God when He destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and their inhabitants?
All who belong to Jesus Christ, regardless of ethnic group or national origin, spiritually are One Big Jewish Family.
God is a God of unconditional love and a God of Judgment.  Everyone without exception shall stand before The Judgment Seat of Christ.  Are you prepared?
Beware the devil. He is real.
Are you being squeezed between a rock and a hard place because God is trying to get your attention?
FODDER TO CHEW ON, Book Two, includes a liberal use of Scripture so you can read the facts for yourself.  Do not allow yourself to be duped by the devil. Our souls are too precious and our choice of an eternal home is too final for us to be guided by misinformation. Regardless of the eternal home you choose  heaven with Jesus Christ or hell with satan - and it is your choice - you need to know what the Bible says so you can make an enlightened decision. Postponing a decision for Jesus Christ is a decision for satan.  You will live with your choice literally forever and that is a long, long time." />
