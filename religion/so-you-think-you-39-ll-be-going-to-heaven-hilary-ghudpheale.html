  <title>So, You Think You&#39;ll Be Going to Heaven! - Hilary Ghudpheale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It seems all too many of us choose to live our lives without God. Modesty and morality are no longer important. Get as much pleasure, accumulate as many material objects, value no one other than ourselves, and live as though death has no hold on us.
Whats the big deal if we saturate our minds with porno morning, noon, and night? Whom are we hurting if we engage in illicit sex, as long as our partner is willing? If the female gets pregnant just go to the local suck clinic and have the kid aborted. Its no big deal.
Weve got all these freedoms, you see. The law says its okay. Important people are our spokespersons, telling us that its our right to decide certain life and death issues for ourselves. Hey, life is good. If anyone tries to give us any static about what we say or do, weve got some gutless politicians to straighten things out.
One day all of us will discover that mans law is not Gods law. And then our asses have had it. Were going to be judged on everything we ever thought, said, or did. And then it will be time to pay the price for the way we chose to live our lives. We rejected God, and now Hell have nothing to do with us. Hell is for eternity!" />
