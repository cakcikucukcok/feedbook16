  <title>YOU CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THE STORM - Gertrude Manu Decker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mama Getty began her book- You can make it through the storms, by encouraging believers that, &amp;ldquo; God is interested in their advancement.&amp;rdquo; She buttressed her point by defining vividly the Hebrew word, &amp;ldquo;shalom&amp;rdquo; that David used in Psalm 35:27. Sister Getty went on to caution believers that certain negative attitudes can hinder them from attaining that shalom (advancement). She mentioned, Trails and Temptation, Unforgiveness, Pride, Disappointment, Persecutions, Weights, and Distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mama Getty further mentioned certain positive attitudes that will propel people to make it through the storms. They are determination, perseverance, holiness, unity, the Divine presence, and constant prayers. The most encouraging chapter was the tenth- The power of God can see you through the storms, so endure. Hence, the believer should rely solely on the power of God, and should also learn to endure in all situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mama Decker concluded her book by saying if believers overcome the negative attitudes and comply with the positive ones, then they will not only be blessed by the Lord, but that they will live peaceful lives. This is not another book on fiction. But it is a book that was birthed from the experiences of somebody who went through the storms of life and overcame them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to blessed by the Lord? Do you want to live a peaceful life? Do you want to overcome the storms of life in this present age of economic crisis, meltdown, crunch, etc? Then get a copy of this book. And the assurance is that with the Lord Jesus in your boat, you will not only sail through the storms of life successfully as Mama Getty did, but that you will further smile at them as well. Remain an overcomer through any storm in Jesus&amp;rsquo; name!&lt;/p&gt;" />
