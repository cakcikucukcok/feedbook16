  <title>The Efficiency of God’s Grace In Bringing Gain Saying Sinners to Christ - Dr. C. Matthew McMahon, Simeon Ashe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Simeon Ashe (d. 1662) was a puritan minister of the Gospel and a member of the Westminster Assembly. Rutherford described him as, “gracious and zealous.”
Biblically, God demonstrates that the only means by which men may be saved is through the regenerating power of the Spirit of God changing their heart, and making them a new creature in Christ. Simeon Ashe proves this from John 6:44, “No man can come unto me except the Father which hath sent me draw him.” He confirms this by six important doctrines: that Christ as mediator between God and man was sent by the Father. That all men in their natural condition are at a distance from Christ. That it is necessary for man to come to Christ. That all those who come to Christ are drawn to him. That the drawing of sinful souls to Christ is the peculiar work of God. 
This rare work is not a scan or facsimile, has been carefully transcribed by hand being made easy to read in modern English, and has an active table of contents for electronic versions." />
