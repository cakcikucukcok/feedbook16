      <meta name="description" content="Penelope Etnier Dinsmore has been laboring in the vineyards of becoming herselfwhat we Jungians call individuationfor more than fifty years. This wonderful book is one of the many fruits of that labor, which also include many glorious paintings. I have always admired her multi-talented creations as I have admired her for being such a beautiful woman who has struggled mightily to find her own, very unique way. The Treasure That Came into the World to Find Its Self is a testament to the strength and grace of the human spirit.
Thomas Singer, MD, Jungian analyst
