  <title>Seven Seasons of the Man in the Mirror - Patrick Morley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Patrick Morley&#39;s compelling follow-up to &lt;em&gt;The Man in the Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, a man is taken beyond the day-to-day problems he faces and is confronted with seven major seasons of life that can make him or break him. Includes a leader&#39;s guide for small groups.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his phenomenally successful &lt;em&gt;The Man in the Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning author Patrick Morley took men for a close-up on crucial aspects of their manhood and challenged them to establish wise priorities in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Seven Seasons of the Man in the Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, Morley shifts the focus to wide-angle. Looking at the broad sweep of life itself, he helps men determine where they are, where they&#39;re headed, and how to get there. Drawing on the lessons of his own life and wisdom from the Bible, Morley presents hard-won perspectives on the seven seasons of Reflection, Building, Crisis, Renewal, Rebuilding, Suffering, and Success--and in so doing, addresses men&#39;s deep longing for direction and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With candor and passion, he speaks to issues every man must face. He illustrates them with true, modern-life stories. And he presents meaty questions for men to chew on and decisions for them to act on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This penetrating, richly encouraging book will help men turn from empty pursuits to the joy, passion, and eternal satisfaction of manhood&#39;s highest purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book was previously titled&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Seven Seasons of a Man&#39;s Life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
