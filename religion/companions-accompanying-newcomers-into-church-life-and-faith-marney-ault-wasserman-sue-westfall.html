  <title>Companions: Accompanying Newcomers into Church Life and Faith - Marney Ault Wasserman, Sue Westfall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is your &quot;new member class&quot; uninspiring? draining energy? Consider a different way of ministering to church newcomers. One that builds on the simple arts of friendship and conversation, instead of classes and presentations. One that invites transformation, rather than just imparting information. One that gives the whole congregation a role to play in the church&#39;s ministry of spiritual hospitality. Companions is an outreach ministry that pairs newcomers in worship with church member companions for eight weeks of conversation about Christian faith and discipleship. One-page conversation guides, grounded in Scripture and prayer, help focus the dialogue on core themes of the life of faith, like gratitude, forgiveness, and community. Companions is designed to build friendships, invite honest sharing, encourage questions, meet newcomers wherever they are, and help them grow in their life with God--exercises that strengthen the faith of church members as well as the newcomers they befriend! If you&#39;re interested in outreach and church growth, in discipleship and spiritual nurture, in expanding the church&#39;s reach in a secular culture, in equipping believers to articulate their faith, in strengthening lay ministries, in keeping baptismal identity at the center of church life--this book will speak to you." />
