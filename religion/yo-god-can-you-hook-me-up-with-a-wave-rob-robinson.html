  <title>Yo God! Can You Hook Me Up With a Wave?! - Rob Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the summer of 1996, Danny decided to go swimming down at the Jersey Shore. It is a blistery day and all Danny wanted to do is to cool his body in the Atlantic Ocean. He chooses to swimming in an area where there are no life guards and very few people walking the beach. He is isolated, but this did not matter to him. It’s how he pictured it, swimming and floating in the refreshing waters of the ocean on a beach all by himself. Danny is enjoying swimming so much that he does not feel the undertow gradually pulling him further and further away from shoreline. What started out as the perfect day at the beach is so becoming terror on the high seas. Realizing his predicament, without hesitation, Danny begins to swim for the shore line. His attempt is futile because he is caught in a rip current. He swims a few feet and then the rip current pulls him back. This cycle recurs repeatedly until muscle fatigued sets in. With barely enough energy to keep his head above water, he stops swimming and begins treading water. His legs and arms are almost lifeless. His eyes are burning from the saltwater and there is a horrible saltwater taste in his mouth. With no one around he could call to or that can see he is in trouble and needed help, what is he going to do? Through this incredible true story, the reader will learn how God helps us when we need Him most." />
