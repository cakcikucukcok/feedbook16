  <title>Comfort Ye My People: a Compilation of Inspirational Works Including Essays, Expository Writing, Poetry, Wisdom Affirmations and Faith Confessions - Lionel Foster Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Comfort Ye My People is born of the authors endeavor, to portray the sentiments of the Living God, towards His people (Jew and Gentile) and to lift, thanks and praise to Jehovah God Almighty, in gratitude for His love towards us.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Both title and content were inspired by the Spirit of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new testament account of Gods dealing with the descendants of Abraham reveals Jesus Christ as the Messiah of both natural Israel (the Jewish nation) and the spiritual Israel (the Gentile believers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spirit of Christ spoke by the prophet Isaiah in the Book of Isaiah. chapter 40 verse 1 and 2 concerning Israels warfare and comfort. He is the same Spirit who indwells the true believer, and who ministers comfort through and by the ministry gifts, for the strength, peace and prosperity of his
people--both Jew and Gentile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our prayers are for the peace of Jerusalem and for the prosperity of those who love her. So we, as the prophet proclaimed, endeavor to carry out the command. &quot;Comfort Ye My People: Saith your God: Speak Ye Comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished and that her iniquity is pardoned: for she has received of the Lords hand double for all her sins&quot;. Isaiah 40:1-2.&lt;/p&gt;" />
