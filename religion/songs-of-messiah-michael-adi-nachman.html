  <title>Songs of Messiah - Michael Adi Nachman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Every single true prophet in the Bible came singin in the name of one true G-d the Father of Yahushua the Messiah whose name is Yahuah. Yahuah, G-d of Abrham, the God of Yitzhak the God of Yaaqob is his name. From Noah with whom Yahuah made a covenant to Jesus (Yahushua) whom Yahuah made into a covenant, they all came in that name.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you can not read Hebrew but wonder what the Bible says in Hebrew, this book is for you. There are literally hundreds of passages in Hebrew and Greek written out in letters of the English alphabet. If you then take those scriptures and make a melody and sing them to Yahuah you will learn the word as the Holy Spirit actually had it written. You will access the ten commandments in Hebrew, the declaration of Yahuah&#39;s unity in Hebrew. Some of the most beautiful Psalms of David in Hebrew all using the English alphabet. This book is unique for those who are hungry for justice and righteousness; hungry for more of prophecy and the prophetic word; hungry for the fear of Yahuah. The Holy Spirit will use this book to speak to leadership saying &quot;This is the way, walk in it&quot;. Get this book and get blessed by Yahuah who made all things. Get this book and get ready for the age to come and the rebuilding of the temple by 2037 if my calculations are correct! Start singing the songs of Messiah in Hebrew today!&lt;P&gt;" />
