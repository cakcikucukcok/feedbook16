  <title>The Lord God of Ten Dispensations in Divisions of Five and Seven - Eli Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This servant-writer, at approximately two-and- a- half -years of age, after having heard a
very dark-complexioned preacher say that God could wash him white as snow and that
he was not afraid to die, moved from the pew to the aisle to see The Book. I desired
to know the all of The Book. I immediately asked the God of all things who was
outside of The Book, the church, and beyond the sky, looking from eternity, to let me
know The Book. I remember from that moment until today that the white as snow
scripture is Isaiah 1:18.
The Biblical disclosure that sins be as white as snow produced an incited desire for the
precise wording of the scriptures with the true meaning. Yet, for all my lifetime, I have
believed that the King James Version of 1611, and the new English spelling which appears
in the late 1792 published edition, authorized by the United States Congress, needs no
human intervention to understand. The Holy Ghost must interpret all scriptural text.
St. John 14:26. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send
in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatsoever I have said unto you.
The Holy Ghost makes overseers of men among men to feed the Church of God, which
He purchased with His own blood.
God is a Spirit: Spirit has not flesh or blood. God purchased the sins in this world for
all time with His own Blood.
I Timothy 3:16. And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was
manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles,
believed on in the world, received up into glory.
Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost
hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his
own blood.  Acts 20:28" />
