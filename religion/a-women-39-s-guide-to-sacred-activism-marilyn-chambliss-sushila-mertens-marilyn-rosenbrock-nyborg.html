  <title>A Women&#39;s Guide to Sacred Activism: - Marilyn Chambliss, Sushila Mertens, Marilyn Rosenbrock Nyborg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In an era in which we are all called to take responsibility for the planet, the restructuring of failing systems, and the levels of racism and sexism, many are feeling helpless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wee guide is easy to read and even easier to follow. It is intended to first support you to do their personal work. Deal with their anger, frustration, and hate before entering the equally angry, frustrating, and hate-filled world of politics and activism. You are encouraged to come into a new level of activism where your motivation for a positive future does not bring with it the antithesis of our current one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the material is meant to inspire you to join with or create the necessary action to bring about that positive change with resources you can join, ideas of how to create action, and willingness to speak up and speak out in loving ways. We must stop matching the war-like energy to the causes and issues we are concerned about. Bring your love and your vision to those you hold as opposition and enemies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us inform, inspire, and activate women to bring our wisdom, perspectives, and ideas to the table of global consequences. &lt;/p&gt;" />
