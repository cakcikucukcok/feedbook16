  <title>All My Road Before Me - C. S. Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A repackaged edition of the revered author&amp;#8217;s diary from his early twenties&amp;#8212;a thought-provoking work that reveals his earliest thinking about war, atheism, religion, and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While serving his country in the Great War, C. S. Lewis&amp;#8217; the great British writer, scholar, lay theologian, broadcaster, and Christian apologist&amp;#8212;made a pact with a close friend and fellow soldier. If one of them died, the survivor would take care of his family&amp;#8212;a promise Lewis honored. Developing a deep friendship with his fallen friend&amp;#8217;s mother, Jane King Moore, Lewis moved into the Moore household after the war. Returning to Oxford, the twenty-three-year old Lewis&amp;#8212;then a staunch atheist&amp;#8212;struggled to adapt to life in post-war England. Eager to help the tormented young man, Jane encouraged him keep a diary of his day-to-day life. Those reflections are collected in this illuminating journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covering five remarkable years in Lewis&#39;s life, &lt;em&gt;All My Road Before Me&lt;/em&gt; charts the inspirations and intellectual and spiritual development of a man whose theology and writing&amp;#8212;including &lt;em&gt;Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, The Great Divorce, The Chronicles of Narnia&lt;/em&gt;, and many other beloved classics&amp;#8212;has had immense influence on the Christian world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
