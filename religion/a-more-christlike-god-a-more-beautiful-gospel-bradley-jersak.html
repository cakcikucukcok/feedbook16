  <title>A More Christlike God: A More Beautiful Gospel - Bradley Jersak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is God like? A punishing judge? A doting grandfather? A deadbeat dad? A vengeful warrior? &amp;#39;Believers&amp;#39; and atheists alike typically carry and finally reject the toxic images of God in their own hearts and minds. Even the Christian gospel has repeatedly lapsed into a vision of God where the wrathful King must be appeased by his victim Son. How do such &amp;#39;good cop/bad cop&amp;#39; distortions of the divine arise and come to dominate churches and cultures? Whether our notions of &amp;#39;god&amp;#39; are personal projections or inherited traditions, author and theologian Brad Jersak proposes a radical reassessment, arguing for A More Christlike God: a More Beautiful Gospel. If Christ is &amp;quot;the image of the invisible God, the radiance of God&amp;#39;s glory and exact representation of God&amp;#39;s likeness,&amp;quot; what if we conceived of God as completely Christlike&amp;mdash;the perfect Incarnation of self-giving, radically forgiving, co-suffering love? What if God has always been and forever will be &amp;#39;cruciform&amp;#39; (cross-shaped) in his character and actions? A More Christlike God suggests that such a God would be very good news indeed&amp;mdash;a God who Jesus &amp;quot;unwrathed&amp;quot; from dead religion, a Love that is always toward us, and a Grace that pours into this suffering world through willing, human partners.&lt;/p&gt;" />
