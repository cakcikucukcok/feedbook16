  <title>Godless Paganism: Voices of Non-theistic Pagans - John Halstead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even in pagan antiquity, there were those who, while participating in the community&#39;s religious life, did not believe in literal gods. In the centuries that followed the Christian domination of the West, the epithet &quot;godless pagan&quot; was leveled at a wide variety of people. In the 1960s, there emerged a community of people who sought to reclaim the name &quot;pagan&quot; from its history of opprobrium. These Neo-Pagans were interested in nature spirituality and polytheism, and identified with the misunderstood and persecuted pagans of antiquity. While many Pagans today believe in literal gods, there are a growing number of Pagans who are &quot;godless.&quot; Today, the diverse assemblage of spiritual paths known as Paganism includes atheist Pagans or Atheopagans, Humanistic and Naturalistic Pagans, Buddho-Pagans, animists, pantheists, Gaians, and other non-theistic Pagans. Here, their voices are gathered together to share what it means to be Pagan and godless." />
