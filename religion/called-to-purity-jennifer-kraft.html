  <title>Called to Purity - Jennifer Kraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christto the glory and praise of God (Philippians 1:911).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passage sums up the heart of &lt;i&gt;Called to Purity: A Chosen Generation&lt;/i&gt;. With everything that tries to pull todays youth away from Christ and into the things of this world, it is more important than ever to instruct them in the true meaning of purity so that they may begin down the road that leads to true righteousness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Called to Purity: A Chosen Generation&lt;/i&gt; presents teens with ideals concerning purity in many different areas of life and encourages them to discover their own convictions in each area, leading teens into a more excellent way of life so that they can bypass the pitfalls of this life and move straight towards a life of righteousness! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be holy, for I am holy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Is holiness really achievable in todays society? &lt;br&gt;
	Can teens really make it to adulthood without succumbing to peer pressure? &lt;br&gt;
	Are temptations and pitfalls really avoidable? &lt;br&gt;
	Can our youth be preserved blameless? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is yes! With God all things are possibleand that includes holiness and purity!&lt;/p&gt;" />
