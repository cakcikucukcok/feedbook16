  <title>Christ’S Deity - Annie Ngana-Mundeke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Christs Deity: The Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ; Truth, Myth and Challenges discusses Christs Deity, an issue of life and death, a challenging issue of ages that challenges the minds of men and women, the mind of anyone who is mature, the issue of truth and power; and that has caused divisions among believers and among non-believers. What is the Truth? Who holds the Truth? Who knows the Truth? Where can we find the Truth? Christ says, Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days [John 2:19 ]; Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away [Matthew 24:35]; I and the Father are one [John 10:30].&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Furthermore, the Lord Jesus Christ states: I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him. [John 14:6-7].&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;God exists, He is Our Creator. God loves us. God created us in His image [Genesis 1:27]. God Created Adam and Eve, God gave Adam His commands, but Adam failed to keep Gods commands. Adam and Eve disobeyed God, they sinned and God punished them [Genesis 3:1-]. Adam caused the Fall of Man, but God created away out to save Man. God did, God did... But who is this God? The LORD Jesus Christ came to earth to save the world. He was called Immanuel, God with us [Matthew 1:23]. His birth was predicted; and He was Called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace [Isaiah 9:6].&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Christs Deity examines passages in Scriptures that surround Christs Deity to help the audience determine the truth about Christs Deity. IS the Lord, Jesus Christ God, Our Creator?&lt;/P&gt;" />
