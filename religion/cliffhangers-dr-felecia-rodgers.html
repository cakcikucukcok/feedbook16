  <title>Cliffhangers - Dr. Felecia Rodgers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The spirit in man causes self-evaluation, reflection and ultimately the search for meaning and lifes purpose. It is the empowering energy of humanity to seek and allow many to find the love of God that surpasses all reasoned understanding. Our lifes journey is replete with mountains. The moments on mountain peaks are times for discovery and choices, conveying a lifetime process of spiritual identity and transformation. In CLIFFHANGERS, examples are offered from the Scriptures of individuals experiencing time at the pinnacle of the mountain, the questions they may have pondered and the outcome of their allotted time on the cliff: To show that every choice results in decisions which affect eternal security; To encourage you to focus on every choice by seeking God for the decision (Prov. 3:5-6); To develop a sincere and unyielding attitude regarding your relationship with God; To place this natural life and all things related to it into proper perspective (II Tim. 4:7); and To learn that all choices lead to a place of decision and all circumstances following each decision can be associated with advancement, neutrality or even decline in spiritual growth. 
The intended audience is anyone struggling with the complexity of life choices or in need of guidance with a life changing decision." />
