  <title>Twelve Steps to the Throne - Rev. Kathy Sandlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her Book, Twelve Steps To The Throne, Rev. Mrs. Kathy Sandlin captures a beautiful portfolio of the Practice of Prayer.  As you read it, I know you will enjoy and be blessed by its depth in knowledge, and the Biblical Structure of the Ministry of Prayer. It will teach us how to come into deeper relationship with God, and will serve as an excellent Training Tool for Intercessory Prayer Groups/Teams. This book will be instrumental in establishing excitement in your personal prayer closet, as well as corporate prayer lives and practices.  After preaching in Reverend Sandlins church and privately praying with her, its a joy for me to release my richest blessing on this wonderful book. I unequivocally recommend for the Body of Christ, Rev. Kathys book, Twelve Steps To The Throne.&lt;br /&gt;

Could You Not Tarry One Hour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve Steps to the Throne is a concise thesis on prayer birthed out of the heart of a genuine intercessor. Rev. Kathy Sandlin has done a tremendous favor to the Body of Christ by allowing the Holy Spirit to compile many years of her experience in prayer.  This book is a must-read for all kingdom-minded Christians. The Kingdom of God is blessed to have this biblical revelation on the subject of prayer.&lt;br /&gt;
