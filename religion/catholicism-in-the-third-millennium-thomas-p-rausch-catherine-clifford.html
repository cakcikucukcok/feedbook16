  <title>Catholicism in the Third Millennium - Thomas  P. Rausch, Catherine Clifford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is Catholicism? And where is the Catholic Church headed in the third millennium? These two questions provide the structure for Thomas Rausch&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Catholicism in the Third Millennium&lt;/i&gt;. Here Rausch combines a faithful presentation of the tradition with a critical theological reflection and interpretation of where the Church is today and where it might be moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Catholicism in the Third Millennium&lt;/i&gt; offers an appreciation of the forces and movements that have shaped, and continue to influence, the ongoing change and development of Roman Catholicism. Chief among these is the influence of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) in reshaping Catholicism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This revised edition includes updated text from Rausch&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Catholicism at the Dawn of the Third Millennium&lt;/i&gt; particularly the final chapter on The Unfinished Agenda&quot; of Vatican II. Each chapter concludes with focus questions developed by Catherine E. Clifford of St. Paul&#39;s University, Ottawa. This experience of guided reading provides readers with a broad survey of Roman Catholic faith and practice in its contemporary context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For readers who wish to compare particular passages of this volume with the &lt;i&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church&lt;/i&gt;, an outline is provided in an appendix, with references to the appropriate sections of the Catechism. A second appendix offers a glossary of terms used in the book, while a third appendix lists a number of basic works for further investigation of Catholic faith and life.&lt;p&gt; Chapters are  *The Church and the Council, -   *Faith and the Believing Community, -   *A Visible Church, -   *a living Tradition, -   *Sacraments and Christian Initiation, -   *Christian Life and Discipleship, -   *Sin, Forgiveness, and Healing, -   *Sexual Morality and Social Justice, -   *Prayer and Spirituality, -   *The Fullness of Christian Hope, -  and  *The Unfinished Agenda. -  Includes &lt;i&gt;Appendix I&lt;/i&gt;: Outlook of Book, with References to the &lt;i&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, Appendix II:&lt;/i&gt; Glossary of Terms, and Appendix III: Basic Reference Works on Catholicism. An &lt;i&gt;Index of Names&lt;/i&gt;, and an &lt;i&gt;Index of Subjects&lt;/i&gt; are also included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thomas P. Rausch, SJ, PhD, is professor of theology at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. He is the author of &lt;/i&gt;Catholicism at the Dawn of the Third Millennium, Reconciling Faith and Reason&lt;i&gt;, and editor of the bestselling &lt;/i&gt;The College Student&#39;s Introduction to Theology&lt;i&gt; published by Liturgical Press.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Catherine E.
