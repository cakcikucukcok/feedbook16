      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Physical healing and delivery from mental and emotional torment are impossible through our own power but not improbable with God. God is in the healing business, and business is good. Believers have access today to the same power that Jesus used to heal all who were afflicted by the Devil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All physical sickness and mental or emotional torment are from the Devil. Jesus came to destroy the works of the Devil and finished the job. We can co-labor with God to do the things &lt;br /&gt;Jesus did. Now is the time to change your way of thinking and believe the good news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experiences described in this book are available to all believers. You can participate with God in miracles, signs, and wonders through the renewing of your mind. Take Jesus at His word, and amazing things will happen in your church, your work and your home.&lt;br /&gt;Why? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because He Said So.&lt;/p&gt;" />
