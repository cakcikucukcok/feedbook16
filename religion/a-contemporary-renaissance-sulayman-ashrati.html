  <title>A Contemporary Renaissance - Sulayman Ashrati</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ashrati&#39;s book is a study of intellectual framework laid out by Fethullah Gulen in his call for the revival of humanity&#39;s changing power. Gulen, a prominent scholar of Islam and a social activist, is the inspiration behind the global network of education, charity and interfaith dialogue. This book is an attempt to show how significant Gulen&#39;s layout for reconstruction is to Islam and to the rest of the world.
In his analysis of Gulen&#39;s thought of reconstruction, Ashrati looks at concepts including the strategy of nonviolence, spiritual dimension of revival, foundations of humanism in Islam, intellectual and spiritual leadership, men of service, and integration of science and religion. His analogy of construction and architectural work comes handy in understanding both the complexity and openness of the call for revival by Gulen." />
