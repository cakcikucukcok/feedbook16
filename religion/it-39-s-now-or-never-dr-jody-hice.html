      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Not since the Revolution has our nation faced greater challenges or more potential for total collapse. America is hanging by a thread. Politics have failed; government policies are disastrous; corruption abounds; the dollar is fading; courts are abandoning the Constitution; morality has been lost ... and the majority of citizens are dreadfully silent. The light from the city on a hill has grown dim. The question is, Will it go out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain: now is the time for action! America originated from an ideal unlike anything previous, consisting of We the people and the foundation of under God. Tragically, the Founders vision has become unrecognizable today. Hence, under God, we the people have a sacred responsibility to be good citizens ~ involved in preserving the moral and political purity of our republic. In fact, our system of government does not work without involvement from the people, so to be disengaged at this critical hour must be considered un-American and unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another revolution is desperately needed if America is to be salvaged, and the sacrificial commitment of our forefathers will be required. Today the enemy is not the British; we are the problem ... but we are also the solution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Its Now or Never&lt;/i&gt; provides a path for reclaiming America. By clearly identifying the key issues that are destroying our nations core, this book sets forth essential steps each citizen can take to help regain our country and become a part of the solution. The light of America can shine again. Your role is vital, but you must act quicklyits now or never!&lt;/p&gt;" />
