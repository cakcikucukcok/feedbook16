  <title>Vinculum Amoris - David T. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christianity is not just a set of moral commands. It is not just belonging to a church. It is not just remembering its founder of long ago! It is all of these, but far more, it is a vital relationship with a living and loving God!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And it is the Holy Spirit, third Person of the God-head, who makes this happen. &quot;Vinculum amoris&quot; is Latin for &quot;bond of love&quot;, which describes the essential activity of the Spirit.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Because the Spirit links us to God, he saves us, guides and empowers us. He enlivens our worship, such as in baptism and the Lord&#39;s Supper. He stimulates our praying, and gives gifts to deepen the quality of our lives and service to God. Because he links us to God, we are linked to each other in a deeper way.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Enriching? yes! And the more that we understand how the Spirit does it, the deeper this enriching will be. The author&#39;s prayer is that this book will do just that for God&#39;s people and for his Church." />
