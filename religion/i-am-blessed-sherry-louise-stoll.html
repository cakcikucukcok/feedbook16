  <title>I Am Blessed - Sherry Louise Stoll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thank you for choosing to read my book, &lt;i&gt;I Am Blessed: A Collection of Faith-Based Prayers and Affirmations&lt;/i&gt;. I am so blessed that we have been brought together in this time and place. Ive written a collection of prayers and matching affirmations. Each begins with the positive action statement, I am blessed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe very strongly in the power of prayer. I see it as a direct connection to God. I believe God is the creator of all that exists. I believe the Holy Spirit dwells within me. I believe Jesus is my Lord and Savior. I believe angels are the messengers of God. I believe in free will. I believe my prayers are heard. I believe the Bible to be true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also believe in the power of affirmations as a tool to create positive change in my life. What I believe I amgood or badis what I become. It is a process, but it is so worth it to take ownership of my life in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, I have repeated each affirmation three times. I find it is a great way to imprint them into my memory. I believe that praying with them is divine reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;" />
