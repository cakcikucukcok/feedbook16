  <title>How to Shake the Unshakable by the True Anointing - The Glory of God</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Revival is the powerful answer to destroy all that belongs to the devil and to stay connected directly to the Holy Spirit. Im not speaking of imitation--yelling or dancing and singing chaotically, but accepting the instruction of God according Proverb 8: 10-11: Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. We have to pay the price by rejecting the foolishness of this world and following the principles of the Spirit. When our hearts are full of love for this worldly system I tell you that we will be the enemies of God. 1 John 2: 15-16 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the worldthe love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
We must, first of all, be filled with the Holy Spirit and get connected with the entire instruction of God to be impacted continually by the true anointing. If we are filled with the world we will supposedly bring the people likewise to Jesus-- like the pagan who wants to convert other pagans using worldly instructions. 
The zeal to pray and to testify has to be in our daily program, manifesting a strong love for Jesus, having compassion for the lost. Here we have to give up all selfish ambition and the condemnation of the law and tradition. We are not in competition with others but we are pleasing God in our speech and our actions. Apostle Paul said in 1Cor 2: 4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wisdom, but by demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God. At this time people are imitating a style of preaching designed to please the flesh and emotions. But we have to know that if the message cannot touch our hearts for change and for repentance, there is a short circuit in what we receive. 
Christians have to schedule enough time to pray and fast, to kill the influence of the flesh inside them and to become sensitive to the Holy Ghost.  Not by might, not by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts (Zech 4: 6). 
The time of ignorance is over, the time of religion is over. This is the time of revival and it will be done by people who decide to give their hearts to the gospel of Christ, surrendering all to Jesus. These are people who pray earnestly and who have enough time to spend with the Lord; reading the Bible and other books of revivalists like CHARLES FINNEY, WIGGLESWORTH, T.L. OSBORN. BONNKE, RAHA MUGISHO, KARAMBIRI, BENSON IDAHOSA and others of Gods vessels." />
