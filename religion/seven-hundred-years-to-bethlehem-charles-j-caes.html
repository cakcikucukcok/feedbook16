  <title>Seven Hundred Years to Bethlehem - Charles J. Caes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;Seven Hundred Years to Bethlehem: 
The Story of the Magi and the Birth of Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In his Gospel, Matthew briefly mentions wise men from the east who followed a celestial ray of light to Bethlehem. They were Magi. As in the case of all biblical passages, a little investigation into this one opens brand-new windows of insight into the past, and historians and other scholars regularly climb through these windows to verify truths and uncover new mysteries. They study, analyze, and speculate not only on the significance of scriptural words and syntax but also on the stories that lie hidden between the lines. In his new book, &lt;I&gt;Seven Hundred Years to Bethlehem&lt;/I&gt;, Charles J. Caes follows after them to bring together the story of the Magi and their search for a promised savior.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Part 1 draws on lay and biblical stories to present a tribal history of the Magi. It covers the seven hundred years from the time ancient wise men arrive on the Iranian plateau until their descendents spot a strange light in the sky and follow it to a stable-cave in Bethlehem. Part 2 draws from canonical and other sources to tell of events surrounding and including the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, the Magis arrival in Bethlehem to find the Holy Family, and the special courage of the Magi. A final chapter summarizes the life of Jesus and draws from non-canonical texts and other sources to speculate on what may have become of Mary, Joseph, and the Magi.&lt;/P&gt;" />
