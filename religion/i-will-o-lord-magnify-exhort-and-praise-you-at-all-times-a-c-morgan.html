  <title>I Will O Lord, Magnify, Exhort and Praise You at All Times. - A.C. Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written to assist the Christian with praising our Lord. For some odd reason we tend to wait for the new car, the new house, the new job, the increase in income before we give God more than the same old Sabbath Day praise.  But He (God) is worthy of more than that from us. God is worthy of praise for the things we dont see, the things we over look and even the things that seem to be insignificant to us.  It is the mighty hand of God that brings forth all righteousness.  And if for no other reason, we should reverence Him for it.
&lt;P&gt;Each passage of scripture will be uplifting as well as inspiring.  Discover the bliss of magnifying God from the depths of your heart. Experience the feeling of God inhabiting your praises. Express the passion you have for the Father and all of His goodness.  Your joy will grab you, and the Holy Spirit within will burn like fire shut up in your bones.  You will find yourself praising the Lord over and over again; and it will become easier and automatic. Like the old saying goes, Itll be a piece of cake." />
