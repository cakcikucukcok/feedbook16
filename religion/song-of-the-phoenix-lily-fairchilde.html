  <title>Song of the Phoenix - Lily Fairchilde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Egyptian mythology, the phoenix was a bird that rose from the ashes of death to attain immortality. In this book, spiritual healer and counselor Lily Fairchilde takes us on a magical voyage during which we learn, in the words of those who have gone on before, what awaits each of us after life on Earth is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens when a child dies, a friend commits suicide, or a lost soul finally ends a dark, Earthly life? In &lt;i&gt;Song of the Phoenix, &lt;/i&gt;we encounter many different souls, accompanied by their spiritual guides of angels, who explain the significance of their stories. Rather than a place of reward and punishment, the afterlife is a wondrous experience of ongoing growth and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Ruth surrendered to despair after her husband&#39;s wartime death and committed suicide, also killing her unborn child. Terrified of punishment, her soul resisted passing over until her guardian angel convinced her that only love and understanding awaited her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Joey was a six-year-old who was killed in a sledding accident and whose parents agonized over his death. He yearns only to reassure them that he has entered a glorious world of brilliant light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Edith and Frank are troubled spirits who cleave to earthly souls who share their addictions to overeating and alcohol, But their guardians refuse to abandon them until they realize that a far more rewarding joy awaits them if only they accept it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Xavier has led an evil life as a sadistic killer, and his soul suffers torment in a wasteland of isolation and pain. But even he has a guardian angel, who patiently waits for him to receive the love and encouragement that will guide him home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These extraordinary personal stories, told by Lily Fairchilde, bring a message of glowing hope and comfort to all those who have suffered the agony of loss or are confronting the fear of death themselves. Profound and compassionate, this book shows the living how to make peace with death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
