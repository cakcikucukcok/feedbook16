  <title>The Story of Spoon, Sweety, and the Four Miracles - Demetria Risper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The day that a person gets married is supposed to be one of the happiest days. We promise to love, honor, and cherish each other for the rest of our lives. Every marriage can be fun in the beginning; the wedding and the honeymoon are all part of the glamour and excitement. But what happens six months later, when the gifts stop coming and routine starts to set in? How do couples in a contemporary world, where careers and children demand so much of their time, manage to keep the sparks of love flying? Do you ever wonder how people stay married for fifty years, and yet still have that same spark they did on their wedding day? Yes, there are going to be problems in every marriage, but a couple whose marriage is based on Jesus Christ and true love will be able to survive. Read about the experiences of Spoon and Sweetys twelve-year marriage that juggles the life of a wife who is a school teacher, a husband who is a high school head football coach, and four children whose ages are ten and under. Laugh about a puppy love that started between two kids in the fourth grade and resulted in an I do at the church altar fifteen years later. Some of the advice could save relationships that are in trouble or help a new marriage remain filled with love. Whether you are skeptical about getting involved in relationships, have been hurt from previous relationships, are trying to figure out what to look for in that special person, or just trying to decide if that other person really loves you, this book, inspired by the Holy Spirit, will hopefully inspire some positive, healthy relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
