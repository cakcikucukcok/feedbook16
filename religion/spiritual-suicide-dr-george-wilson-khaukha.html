  <title>Spiritual Suicide - Dr. George Wilson Khaukha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Almost everybody has had this experience in life. This is to do with figuring out the map instructions somebody has given you to find a place you have never been to before. If you form a different mental map image in your mind from the instructors you will surely get lost. It is critical that you and the instructor hold the same mental image of the map instructions. This treatise attempts to ensure that we have the same mental image of Gods call for our salvation as what God Himself had and still has on His mind. Thus we will never have doubts about our spiritual journey. We can very clearly grade ourselves as PASS or FAIL without needing a famous preachers consolation, enlightenment or switching between denominations.
This is a very short treatise to capture the attention of everybody during this modern high paced way of survival and challenge the reader to audit himself/herself whether he/she is positively headed for Gods call and living according to His will. After grasping the message in this treatise the reader will no longer have doubts about his/her status in relationship with God, using the self-audit spiritual checklist provided at the end of this treatise. I keep having this feeling that the enemy has camouflaged interpretations of Gods word to appease the believers that they are on the right track when actually they are headed for destruction." />
