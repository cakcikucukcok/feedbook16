  <title>Faith, Not Religions - Chatha Akbar Ghulam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author &lt;strong&gt;Chatha Akbar Ghulam&lt;/strong&gt; believes God is universal. With love as his message, he shares a thought-provoking collection of essays, poems, and meditations illustrating how he has come to understand the concept of God and why he feels a loving heart is the only requirement needed to have faith in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chatha shares how as a youth he came to discard the traditional teachings of heredity and customs and eventually achieved inner peace and contentment by recognizing universal good and truth. As he offers his opinion on such subjects as God and war, life and death, wisdom versus ignorance, the yearnings of a soul, and heaven and hell, Chatha provides a fresh, impartial perspective on Gods influence in todays world. By sharing his thoughts on the differences between the self-righteous and true believers through personal anecdotes and inspiration from Punjabi mystic poets, Chatha quietly encourages spiritual seekers of all faiths to look inward and focus on gratitude rather than desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faith, Not Religions&lt;/em&gt; offers one mans inspiring reflections regarding his faith in God, his opinions on organized religions, and his journey to seek his own spiritual path in life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
