  <title>Who Is Your Friend? - Martin N. Kwaning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A true friend is someone who sees the pain in your eyes while everyone else believes the smile on your face.   Unknown Author
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book was inspired by the wonders of God that I have   seen in my personal life and other peoples lives. This book &#39;who is your friend seeks to establish the fact that no matter what situation you find yourself in, you have to find solace in the fact that God is there for you. We live in a world where people have persistently ignored the needs of others. We have allowed nepotism, race, status, and where one comes from as a barometer to assist those in need of help.
You might have witnessed how friends and family have deserted you and have been wondering who is there for you. Rests assure that God is there for you. I have tried him and I am overjoyed what the good Lord has done. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I am desperately searching for someone who I can call a friend, a person who my worries will be his, my growth in life will be his concern, and my burdens will be his too.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have to keep on searching for this friend! For I forget my pass and press on in great diligent to see this friend. There is no time to waste and the journey to find this friend must start today.." />
