  <title>A Closer Look Iii - Robert L. Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Closer Look III is the third in a series of a collection of morning and evening Christian devotionals. They were developed from the Lords inspiration during times of personal prayer and Bible study. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Included in this series are a number of devotions on the longest chapter in the BiblePsalm 119. It contains twenty-two parts. Each of the twenty-two parts aligns in order to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet (Aleph, Beth, Gimel, etc.). The reader will note that several terms appear multiple times throughout the entire Psalm. These terms include commandments, judgment, law, precepts, statutes, testimonies, Word (Gods Word). In all, these terms appear 132 times throughout this Psalm. King David penned Psalm 119 to highlight Gods sacred character and his great love for man. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These devotions are intended to encourage the reader to take a closer look at Gods Word during daily quiet times in the presence of our Lord. They can be read over the course of a month and then repeated in subsequent months. As an alternate method of study, the reader may choose to review the table of contents for a topic that may be of interest or review the scripture references at the end of the text to locate those devotions that may include a favorite verse.&lt;/p&gt;" />
