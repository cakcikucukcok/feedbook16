  <title>On the Great Reunion Ingathering Journey - Susan E. Craig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once before God called out a people to be His special people and a priestly nation before the world.  Now again God has called out people to be His and walk before Him as an example to all peoples, calling the people of the world to Him.
Now as then He is ingathering us from the far country to which we had wandered and setting us on our betrothal journey home.  We can discern much from the first such journey of ingathering that can assist and encourage us as we set out on our own journey of ingathering.  This is one persons look at what God has told us about our Tabernacles and what to expect and watch for along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a walk through Gods Word, searching to see the intent and symbolism contained in the Tabernacle/Temple structure, decorations and rituals with an eye to how these thing might apply to us today.  For we have been told that our bodies are now the temple or tabernacle of the Holy Spirit and God has told us previously His specifications for maintaining this space properly so that when we go to Him, He can be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book looks at what was lost when man was banished at the beginning; as this is what will be restored at the end times.  From there a look was taken at what was elaborated in His Word about Gods purpose, requirements and expectations via the Covenants, Prophets and Law.  The last section concentrates on the Tabernacle, its specifications, attendants and Feast Day.  For today each of us is now serving as priest before the presence of the Holy Spirit within us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
