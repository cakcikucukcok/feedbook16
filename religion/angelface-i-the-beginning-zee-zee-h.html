  <title>Angelface I: the Beginning - Zee-Zee H.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This a long look into my many journal entries growing up in middle school and high school crushes and so-called true loves. This is my closure to those days and those who have hurt me; letting them know that through the Grace and Mercy and Love of Jesus Christ and His Father; they are forgiven and that they didn&#39;t know what they were doing; and how it would be God&#39;s use of them that would shape the person I am today and letting them know that they just made me into a fighter and made my skin that much thicker but still softer so that I can enjoy the many blessing God has allowed my eyes to see in this life; so that I can realize who the true BOSS is! He is the only true friend and love you and I both truly have; no matter what we do. 
This is a look into what many teens and young adults still deal with today; but at a much higher scale; and how important it is to have family and friends there to prepare you, and build you up; when others don&#39;t know what they are doing. Jesus said: &quot;Father forgive them for they no not what they do.&quot; Once you have discovered who God is and how much He is in control and loves you like a father; what others may say about you don&#39;t matter that much anymore. He is waiting on you...will you answer his call or keep running? Abba/Father, please let whom ever reads this book be beckoned by you in a way they have never been before. Abba/Father, please don&#39;t give up on them. Continue to love on them; in Jesus&#39; name..Amen." />
