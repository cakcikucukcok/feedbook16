  <title>Full-Time Savior - Marcus Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mathematician and accountant by trade, Marcus Bradley combines his analytical nature with a unique writing style to craft a message that many Christians need. Designed to simplify the concept of grace in our minds, introduce more freedom to the burdened soul, and give all the credit to Jesus Christ for the hope of salvation, Full-Time Savior delivers a new insight on every page.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The core of this message is that we cannot save ourselves, and neither can the codes we live by. We are saved only by grace through Christ, in the good times and the bad. There is never a reason to get down on yourself for having a rough day, nor is there basis to be proud on a good onebecause Jesus is better than your best and He covers up your worst. He is your full-time Savior, when you deserve it and when you dont.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Our nature, both individually and corporately, is to complicate the gospel and magnify the human role in salvation and justification. This book diagnoses such tendencies, and dissects them in a way that is certain to stimulate your thoughts, impact your heart, and re-focus your attention squarely onto the cross.&lt;/p&gt;" />
