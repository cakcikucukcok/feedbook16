  <title>The Translation of Surah Al-Fatihah &amp; Surah Al-Baqarah English Edition - Muhammad Vandestra, Jannah Firdaus Foundation</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Translation &amp;amp; The Meaning of Surah Al-Fatihah &amp;amp; Surah Al-Baqarah from The Holy Quran In English Languange Color Version.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S?rat al-F?ti?ah&lt;/b&gt; (Arabic: ??????? ???????????&amp;lrm;) is the first chapter (&lt;i&gt;surah&lt;/i&gt;) of the Quran. Its seven verses (&lt;i&gt;ayat&lt;/i&gt;) are a prayer for the guidance, lordship and mercy of God. This chapter has an essential role in Islamic prayer (&lt;i&gt;sal?t&lt;/i&gt;). The primary literal meaning of the expression &amp;quot;al-F?ti?ah&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;The Opener,&amp;quot; which could refer to this Surah being &amp;quot;the opener of the Book&amp;quot; (&lt;i&gt;F?ti?at al-kit?b&lt;/i&gt;), to its being the first Surah recited in full in every prayer cycle (&lt;i&gt;rak?ah&lt;/i&gt;), or to the manner in which it serves as an opening for many functions in everyday Islamic life. Some Muslims interpret it as a reference to an implied ability of the Surah to open a person to faith in God&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The name &lt;i&gt;al-F?ti?ah&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;quot;the Opener&amp;quot;) is due to the subject-matter of the surah. &lt;i&gt;F?ti?ah&lt;/i&gt; is that which opens a subject or a book or any other thing. It is also called &lt;i&gt;Umm Al-Kitab&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;quot;the Mother of the Book&amp;quot;) and &lt;i&gt;Umm Al-Quran&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;quot;the Mother of the Quran&amp;quot;);&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sab&amp;#39;a al Mathani&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;quot;Seven repeated [verses]&amp;quot;, an appellation taken from verse 15:87 of the Quran);&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Al-Hamd&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;quot;praise&amp;quot;), because a hadith narrates Prophet Muhammad SAW&amp;nbsp; as having said: &amp;quot;The prayer [al-F?ti?ah] is divided into two halves between Me and My servants. When the servant says, &amp;#39;All praise is due to God&amp;#39;, the Lord of existence, God says, &amp;#39;My servant has praised Me&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Al-Shifa&amp;#39;&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;quot;the Cure&amp;quot;), because a hadith narrates Prophet Muhammad SAW as having said: &amp;quot;The Opening of the Book is a cure for every poison.&amp;quot;, &lt;i&gt;Al-Ruqyah&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;quot;remedy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;spiritual cure&amp;quot;).,and al-Asas, &amp;quot;The Foundation&amp;quot;, referring to its serving as a foundation for the entire Quran.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S?rah al-Baqarah&lt;/b&gt; or &amp;quot;The Cow&amp;quot; is the second and longest chapter (Surah) of the Qur&amp;#39;an. It consists of 286 verses, 6201 words and 25500 letters (Ibn Kathir). It is a Mediniite surah, that is to say that it was revealed at Medina after the Hijrah, with the exception of a few verses which Muslims believe was revealed during the last Hajj of Prophet Muhammad SAW The Farewell Pilgrimage. This is the longest Surah in the Quran. It was the first Surah to be revealed at Medina, but different verses were revealed at different times, covering quite a long period so much so that the verses with regard to riba (interest or usury) were revealed in the final days of Prophet Muhammad SAW, after the conquest of Makkah (Maariful Quran)." />
