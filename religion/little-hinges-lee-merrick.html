&lt;p&gt;why He opposed the Jewish religious leaders; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why He didnt reveal His full identity to His disciples in the very beginning of His ministry; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what caused His own people to turn against Him; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why He was crucified and why He is coming back; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what we should do now to avoid being left behind when He returns for His followers. &lt;/p&gt;
