  <title>Thanks for the Dance: Transforming Grief into Gratitude When Your Spouse Dies - Fred Abrams, Jeri Abrams;</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Your spouses death catapults you into a nightmare -likely the most stressful event of our life. You feel numb, loneliness overwhelms you, you feel adrift - desperate for something to hang onto. You want to pull the covers up over your head and make this all go away. The pain and suffering seem unbearable. You search for some magic answer or formula to make things all better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred and Jeri are two ordinary folks who have both been there and found a pathway they hope will help you find your way too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain is Inevitable - Suffering is Optional -Buddhist Proverb &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing will make the pain of this loss magically go away. You can reduce the suffering. Fred and Jeri offer numerous suggestions for dealing with the things we all experience, several unique exercises to help you figure out important feelings and emotions, and many inspirational quotations. They talk about things seen in no other book. They made it though this nightmare and so can you! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no expectation of finding the book so engaging and so on point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Devine, widower &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your book is a kind and generous action to help others during one of the hardest times in a life. Thanks for caring enough to share light when others are in the dark. Fred Dudding, widower &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a personal support group, helps through the pain of loss and charting a course for those who have loved and lost. An essential guide that offers hope and guidance to those who are grieving. A truly wonderful way to reframe the dark days of hopelessness that follow the death of a partner! And what a gift this roadmap to rebuilding a life this can be for the partner! &lt;/p&gt;
