We are posting our sins to the cross, the cross that was and is only a symbol of remembrance of how and why Jesus Christ died for our sins.
What Jesus did that day, but most importantly is doing for us even now, seems to be buried in the sands of time, almost forgotten.
But its in the right position to be picked up and carried, as the scripture says in Luke 9:23, Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me." />
