  <title>Eventually He Believed God! - Christopher S. Peterkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The name Abraham has been heard in many homes and faith. From the north to the south, going west, then travelling to the east, he has a place in many hearts and cultures.
To say this in fewer words, Abraham has a prominent place in the lives of many and in their faith.
For centuries, until now, the question has plagued the mind of many Bible theologians, students, and the like, even mine, Why did Abram, after receiving a portion of the blessing which his Lord had promised, left it for something else of lesser value?
The enquiring questions really should have been the following:
Did Abram really believe God?
Was his going just obedience?
How much did he trust God?
His life is a description of many today, who goes to the house of prayer and worship where God speaks to them and, upon leaving the door of the sanctuary, goes in a different direction.
I remember one very wise man saying, Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him and He will direct thy paths (Proverbs 3:56)." />
