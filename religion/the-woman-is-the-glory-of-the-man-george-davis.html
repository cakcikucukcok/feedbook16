When God created the marriage institution, He installed spiritual roles for the man and woman. When these roles would reverse themselves, intervention from God always followed. This has been an established pattern all through the Bible. 
It first manifested with Adam and Eve in the garden. It followed the downfall of the sons of God right before the flood. And it brought judgment to Solomon shortly after he began to worship the gods of his wives. 
The New Testament is full of warnings to the churches about following the spiritual authority given to the man and woman. These warnings are basically ignored today. 
The marriage relationship, when spiritually understood, clearly prophesies that we will experience the end times during our lifetime." />
