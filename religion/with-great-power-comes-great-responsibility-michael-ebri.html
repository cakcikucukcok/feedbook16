  <title>With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility . . . - Michael Ebri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility . . . The Call
Every power has responsibilities. These responsibilities
assume peculiar powers. The power in a call is the sensitive
revelation of God made strong in a man by God, to cause
mankind, and existence come under His wholesome
influence; it is the responsibility of the person with the
call to exercise.
Now, the trouble in many minds not knowing where to
start, how to know their part in the plan of God, and live
through that plan has made many people, pilgrims of the
earth, but spectators in the will of God. This is Michael
Ebris just weight that these persons will lose in their
inheritance in God.
The call is a persons planned existence, which is his
responsibilities in God for mankind. Being guided on how
to recognise and live that plan is vivid in this book. The
book, thus, serves as both manual to the responsibilities in
the call in some detail and the revelations of the mind of
God for the call in some other detail." />
