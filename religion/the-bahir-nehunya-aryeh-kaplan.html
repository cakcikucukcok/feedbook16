  <title>The Bahir - Nehunya, Aryeh Kaplan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The &lt;i&gt;Bahir&lt;/i&gt; is one of the oldest and most important of all classical Kabbalah texts. Until the publication of the &lt;i&gt;Zohar&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;Bahir&lt;/i&gt; was the most influential and widely quoted primary source of Kabbalistic teachings. The &lt;i&gt;Bahir&lt;/i&gt; is quoted in every major book on Kabbalah, the earliest being the Raavad&#39;s commentary on Sefer Yetzirah, and it is cited numerous times by Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (Ramban) in his commentary on the Torah. It is also quoted many times in the &lt;i&gt;Zohar&lt;/i&gt;. It was first published around 1176 by the Provence school of Kabbalists; the first printed edition appeared in Amsterdam in 1651. The name &lt;i&gt;Bahir&lt;/i&gt; is derived from the first verse quoted in the text (Job 37:21), &quot;And now they do not see light, it is brilliant (Bahir) in the skies.&quot; It is also called the &quot;Midrash of Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKana,&quot; particularly by the Ramban. The reason might be that Rabbi Nehuniah&#39;s name is at the very beginning of the book, but most Kabbalists actually attribute the &lt;i&gt;Bahir&lt;/i&gt; to him and his school. Some consider it the oldest kabbalistic text ever written. Although the &lt;i&gt;Bahir&lt;/i&gt; is a fairly small book, some 12,000 words in all, it was very highly esteemed among those who probed its mysteries.
