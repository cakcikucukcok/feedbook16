  <title>Euthanasia, Suicide, and Despair: Can the Bible Help?: Guidance When Faced with Ethical Dilemmas - Michael J.  Lowis, Albert Jewell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Despite its title, this is not a morbid or depressing book, but one that it is hoped will bring encouragement and comfort to all who are experiencing life&#39;s difficulties, even to the point of wondering if they wish to continue living. However, the question of whether or not it is morally acceptable for people to receive help to end their lives prematurely is a divisive one, but it is one that cannot be ignored. Some countries have already legalized voluntary euthanasia, whilst others are still wrestling with this ethical dilemma. We all hope that we will never be faced with this situation but, if it does arise, where can we turn for help and guidance? The Bible is one useful resource, as over fifty passages have been identified that relate to coping with desperate life circumstances, along with a few instances where a life has been ended prematurely. In addition to identifying and discussing these passages, this book also provides helpful background on the history of the biblical sources used, along with factors influencing their interpretation. Reading this book should provide strength and courage to persevere through life&#39;s adversities." />
