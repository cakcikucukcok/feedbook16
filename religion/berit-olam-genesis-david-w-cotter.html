  <title>Berit Olam: Genesis - David  W. Cotter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central thesis underlying this study of Genesis is that the God who is revealed as a character in Genesis is always a savior. In Genesis, David Cotter, OSB, helps readers discern a structure in the book whereby the least and the weakest are the object of God&#39;s saving help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Genesis&lt;/i&gt; begins with an introduction to the methodology that is used throughout the book. The introductory essay deals with the theory of Hebrew narrative and the challenges posed to biblical exegesis by contemporary literary theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theme of the commentary itself is that the God who is revealed as a character in Genesis is always a savior. This is true in the Stories About Beginnings (Genesis 1-11) and the Stories About the Troubled Family Chosen for Blessing (Genesis 12-50). The Egyptian slave Hagar, not Abraham, is read as the central figure of the family&#39;s first generation and Tamar, the cast-off daughter-in-law as the moral center of the fourth generation. God is savior above al for those whose need is greatest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapters in &lt;i&gt;Part One - Stories About Beginnings: Genesis 1-1&lt;/i&gt;1 are The Story of the Creation of al That Is: Genesis1:1-2:3,&quot;  *The Story of the Creation of Man and Woman, the Paradise in Which They Lived and Which They Chose to Lose.
