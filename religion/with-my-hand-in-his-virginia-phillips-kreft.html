  <title>With My Hand in His - Virginia Phillips Kreft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you desire intimacy with Jesus? He desires it with you. A look at the Song of Solomon confirms that. Just as with a husband and wife, intimacyreal oneness with Himrequires above all else, love and selflessness, and must include determination, time, and faithfulness. So it is with our Bridegroom Jesus Christ. Is your path of life difficult? He says This is the way, walk in it. Learn to read and follow His road map, as you grasp tightly to His hand and follow Him, through the seasons of life. Be encouraged as the author shares years of personal experience and life lessons. Learn some of the most essential elements required to abiding in Christmoment by moment consciously aware of, and present to, His presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanning the seasons of life with a variety of subjects, the author speaks to the heart of all readers. Wherever you are in your Christian walk, WITH MY HAND IN HIS will arouse in you a new desire for a deeper relationship with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be astonished at what God accomplished in a young womans life because she never gave up hope in Him. In WITH MY HAND IN HIS, I am reminded that God is who He says He is, and we can confidently rely on Him through all the seasons of our lives, if we keep our hand in His and believe that hope lives on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I know (but God knew), when the author asked me to help her edit her writing, I would be in deep need of the encouragement found in her book.&lt;/p&gt;
