  <title>Blessings: Questions and Answers - J. Michael Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book covers significant questions and answers regarding our God-given blessings. It first discusses issues concerning both our early-life nature-oriented blessings and the ones later in life, which are goal-oriented. The point is that currently in life each of us is blessed with a God-given goal for our remaining time on earth. The book initially addresses what a blessing is, where it has come from, how important it is, and what our responsibilities for achieving it are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant part of the book involves eight major blessing areas, including friendship, love, and religion. The largest value to you is coverage of each of these areas with detailed definitions of blessing statements, visions, action plans, goals, and performance measures. These examples will help identify and address your specific God-given goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another inspiring, supportive part of each blessing area is a poem. The subject for each poem is for the blessing statement to help emphasize the important mindset you need to achieve that particular blessing goal. If desired, you can adjust, add, or subtract the verses and words to these poems as needed to make them more appropriate for your goals and meaning in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the book addresses Gods goal for our lives as defined by the blessings He has given us. The books approach may likely result in more detailed understanding of your blessings and provide an improved chance of success. More importantly, the book emphasizes an approach that will improve our lives as Gods children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
