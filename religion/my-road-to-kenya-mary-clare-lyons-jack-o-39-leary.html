  <title>My Road to Kenya - Mary Clare Lyons, Jack O&#39;Leary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Together we shared a mostly happy journey  facing and overcoming 
obstacles, meeting fascinating people wherever we went while falling completely in love with the people of Kenya. This book is a tribute to my co-laborers and in 
writing this book I hope to show that one does not need to be a hero to step out, 
take risks and make the world a better, healthier and happier place.
Jack OLeary
An archbishop, an environmentalist and an AIDS activist are only a few of the heroes, who stood up against a ruthless dictator and corrupt government, in Jack OLearys My Road to Kenya.
My Road to Kenya shines a light on a group of everyday heroes who believe they were called to 
make a difference in the lives of the people of Kenya. Fate and faith led them to the crossroads where their paths converged. Working together they have built and supplied hospitals, clinics, schools, 
churches, and homes for hundreds of children
many of whom were orphaned by HIV/AIDS. Through it all they asked for nothing for themselves. Yet in the end, the collaborations of these everyday heroes resulted in something invaluable  the forging of deep and long-lasting friendships." />
