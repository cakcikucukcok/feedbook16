  <title>This Lady Here - Carol Ann Rusch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This book is one person&#39;s travels through a catalogue of nightmare experiences. Anyone who has suffered through divorce of any form knows this one!! Abuse of various natures are present in this autobiography. Not so much the cure for, but mostly, the acceptance of and forgiveness ability. The emotional healing process does call for the time element, unfortunately! However, this book tells about different aspects of ways and means to this beautiful end. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book is not for people looking for a quick fix or a way out. Abstinence from alcohol is a tool which many people have used as a problem solver. This book is only one person&#39;s life under both chronic inebriation and total abstinence conditions. There are many adventures where the reader might question the physical influence under which the author was operating. Even without the alcoholic consumption by the author, the behavior, when compared to the behavior of a well adjusted individual are incredibly different!!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;People who have loved or been loved by those who are immediately involved with alcohol or drugs may gain a deeper understanding of the total situation. Also, the author hopes that some comfort to the reader will take place upon the realization that they are not alone. The greatest gift the author has received from life, is PEACE ON EARTH.&lt;/P&gt;" />
