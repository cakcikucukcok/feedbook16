      <meta name="description" content="Many people had dark moments in their lives that was beyond their control. Can you think of a dark moment in your life that devastated you and you felt you had no where to go? Have you ever lost a child or love one and wondered, &quot;How will I ever get over this pain&quot;? Sometimes the pain lingers on and on and you not sure how you can get it to subside. Will I ever have peace of mind again with this person out of my life or will this dark moment ever pass?  Was there something I could of done to prevent this situation? There are so many questions that go through your head that may be unanswered for you or an unsettled feeling that you have and not sure what to do with it. In this dark moment the Holy Spirit carried me through with the assurance that my son was at rest and well taken care of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hopefully, this book will answer some of those questions and bring peace to you while the pages unfold as you read them.

Dorothy, the book came last week Im on page 51 I must tell you ,there is so much truth and pain and up-lifting moments . Every time I go through a painful paragraph, tears come memories of my experiences cross my heart and I just hug the book and I feel Gods presence, and the tears stop, I know why my husband my two daughters my real dad all passed on was because God didnt want me to have any interruptions while I took care of my Mom, she has always been there for me no matter what ,and I miss her so much, but one day,  anyway your book is so fulfilling and very deep , I absolutely love it , good luck with it, and may God continue to Bless you always.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This book offers us hope thru Gods love and grace to carry us thru many heart aches found in the darkest hours of our journey here on earth.  It will break your heart and strengthen your faith.  This book shows us how God will always answer us when we cry out to Him, &quot;God I Need You&quot;.  It will give you the courage to go on and find joy and peace in your life again.
