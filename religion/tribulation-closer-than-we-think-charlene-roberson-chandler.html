  <title>Tribulation, Closer Than We Think - Charlene Roberson Chandler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="TRIBULATION
CLOSER THAN WE THINK
____________________________
After two days he will revive us;
 on the third day he will restore us,
 that we may live in his presence.
                             (Hosea 6:2 NIV.) 
___________________________
Israel is Gods prophetic time clock. The Nation Israel was revived (barely) in 1948. Are we now living in the third day, according to Hoseas prophecy, in which Israel will be totally restored and live in the presence of the Lord during the Millennium?
FOLLOW STEP-BY-STEP END-TIMES PROPHECIES
Pertinent to our times of increasing worldwide disasters of earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, pollution, and changing weather patterns possibly leading to food shortages, plus political and economic turmoil, this book is non-denominational tracking the Scriptures in an easy to understand outline of prophecy beginning with Christs birth and going through end-times with a scenario that reconciles scientific data to the Biblical account of the creations.  It includes prophecies of Christs birth and their fulfillment, the beautiful angel Lucifers (Satan) fall, Israels final punishment, rise of the Anti-Christ, the Great Tribulation, Christs Second Coming, life during the Millennium, the Judgment Seat of Christ, the Great White Throne Judgment, how the Second Death relates to Hell, and finally the glories awaiting Christians in eternity." />
