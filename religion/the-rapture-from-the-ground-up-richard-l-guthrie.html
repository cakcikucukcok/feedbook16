  <title>The Rapture: from the Ground Up - Richard L. Guthrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Pre-Tribulational Rapture theory of the end times is the most prevalent and well-known end time scenario of the Bible. It is well entrenched and established in most fundamental churches. The Pre-Tribulational Rapture has been popularized by the Left Behind book and movie series. However, consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the blessed hope was not a promise of the Rapture?&lt;br /&gt;
What if the wrath the Church was not appointed to had nothing to do with the Tribulation? &lt;br /&gt;
What if the Rapture is not and cannot be an imminent event?&lt;br /&gt;
What if the Antichrist will not and cannot rule over the entire world? &lt;br /&gt;
What if the Church is not missing during any portion of the book of Revelation?&lt;br /&gt;
What if the falling away in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 is only a reference to the end time apostasy of the Church predicted by Jesus?&lt;br /&gt;
What if only unbelievers enter into the Millennial Kingdom?&lt;br /&gt;
What if Enoch is no more a representation of a Pre-Tribulational Rapture than Elijah is a representation of a Post-Tribulational Rapture?&lt;br /&gt;
What if the time at which both the Rapture and the Second Coming will occur is unknown?&lt;br /&gt;
What if Jesus, Paul, and Daniel presented the exact same end-time scenario?&lt;br /&gt;
What if a literal interpretation of Scripture reveals a Post-Tribulational Rapture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a detailed and thorough analysis of Scripture, The Rapture: From the Ground Up explores these and many more questions related to the end-time events surrounding the Rapture in a step-by-step approach. This eschatological study is unsurpassed in detail for the knowledgeable Bible student and yet remains basic, simple, and straightforward for the novice. Using a literal interpretation of Scripture, the Post-Tribulational Rapture is the undeniable result of such a diligent and literal study of Gods Word.&lt;/p&gt;" />
