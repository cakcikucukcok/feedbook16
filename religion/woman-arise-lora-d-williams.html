  <title>Woman Arise - Lora D. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Woman, Arise will walk with you through every aspect of your life: overcoming your past, having an intimate relationship with God, and walking into your purpose. Women were created to transform anything; an empty room becomes a home at the touch and imagination of a woman. Its time for women to arise into their God-given identities. Many women are long overdue to truly operate in their full potential. This book may cause you to look within, to uproot the old, and to allow newness to spring forth. You will be encouraged, empowered, and challenged to go to a place God longs for you to be, a place where you know God, your identity, and your purpose. You were designed to be dynamic, great, and powerful in a time when the world needs you the most. Arise, woman, into your God-given position!&lt;/p&gt;" />
