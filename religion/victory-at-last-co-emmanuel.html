  <title>Victory at Last - Co Emmanuel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If what the enemies have stolen, destroyed, diverted, and polluted in your life is not making you mad, you may not accord this book the seriousness it rightly deserves. If your desire for change, restoration, and total recovery is not at an emergency level, you may see this book as any other book that is totally erroneous. This is not just another book. It is your key to divine intervention and total recovery. You have read books, gone to churches, and prayed prayers. This is a gift to our generation to unlock the secret of satanic oppression and usher the children of God into the center of Gods will for their lives.
The conditions for using this book are high, but one thing is certain: you cannot comply with them without having a result. Jesus, because of the glory that was set before him, endured the cross, despite the shame, and is set at the right hand of majesty. As he is, so are we in this world. Therefore, because of the testimonies awaiting you, pay the price and cross over to the other sidethe side of glory (not story), side of inheritance, and side of your divine destiny. Bear in mind that anything God can do, prayer can do it. Every chapter and every prayer point in this book were directly inspired by the Lord. See you on the other side. Amen." />
