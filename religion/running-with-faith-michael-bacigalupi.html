  <title>Running with Faith - Michael Bacigalupi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have to admit I struggle with my faith, but my faith has been the reason that I have gotten this far.  I seem to question my faith when things go bad and forget and not give God any credit when things are going good.  So I ask hows your faith, because mine is stronger and getting stronger every day.  Come read with me on some points I learned in our Sunday School Class.  I write about this because when you see all that inspires me while I run or compete in marathons and triathlons than there is no way you cant see Gods work.
When I am competing in any events especially long events, I catch myself talking to God.  Even though I am running with thousands of people, you are still by yourself.  I have to pray or talk to God or I will find myself starting to think about the long distance to much and negative thought starts creeping in my mind.  
This book will inspire you with touching stories of courage and faith." />
