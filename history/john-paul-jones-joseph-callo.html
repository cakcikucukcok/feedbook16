  <title>John Paul Jones - Joseph Callo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This fresh look at America&amp;#8217;s first sea warrior avoids the hero worship of past biographies and provides a more complete understanding of his accomplishments. Writing from the perspective of a naval officer with more than thirty years of experience and a seaman with a lifetime of sailing know-how, Callo examines Jones&amp;#8217; extraordinary career by going beyond his legendary naval achievements to establish him as a key player in the American Revolution. Analyzing his relationships with important civilian leaders of the Revolution, such as Benjamin Franklin, the author demonstrates how Jones&amp;#8217; handling of those often difficult dealings contributed to the nation&amp;#8217;s concept of civilian control of the military. In this acclaimed biography, Jones is shown to be not only a highly-skilled and relentless commander, but the first serving American naval officer to emphasize the role the Navy could play in the rise of the United States as a global power. &lt;/div&gt;" />
