  <title>The Volcano Is Our Home - Alan Robert Akana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Volcano Is Our Home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Alan Akana realized he had missed the gift of hearing many of his familys stories, his search for his history became a gift to all his readers. The Volcano is Our Home introduces us in a very personal way to the influences that shaped Hawaii from an isolated group of islands inhabited by remarkable people with a unique and beautiful culture into the tourist mecca known today by travelers from all over the world. The author takes you to the real Hawaii, so that you may walk these islands with new understanding of the lost way of life of those who have gone before. You will journey over 250 years with a Hawaiian family, guided by their connection to the land, each other and a rich spiritual realm. You will join them on the slopes of Kilauea Volcano as they confront the arrival of each new wave of changefrom Captain Cook to the missionaries, to the overthrow of the kingdom, to the 50th State, to the 21st century. Alan Akana is one of the current generation of Hawaiians who has perfected the art of talking story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gail Larsen, Founder of Real Speaking and Author of Transformational Speaking: If You Want to Change the World, Tell a Better Story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Excerpt from the Book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ancestors simply could not ignore the goddess who lived among &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;them and continued to appear in their midst. As the culture changed dramatically, Pele was a constant presence from generation to generation. While villages disappeared, species became extinct, churches were established, and governments were stolen, the relationship between the people who lived on the slopes of Kilauea and Pele remained firm as ever; and the people continued to make sacrifices and prayers to her in the same way as their ancestors did centuries before them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
