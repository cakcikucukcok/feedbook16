  <title>Making Women’s Histories - Pamela S. Nadell, Kate Haulman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Making Women&#39;s Histories &lt;/em&gt;showcases the transformations that  the intellectual and political production of women&amp;#8217;s history has  engendered across time and space. It considers the difference women&amp;#8217;s  and gender history has made to and within national fields of study, and  to what extent the wider historiography has integrated this new  knowledge. What are the accomplishments of women&amp;#8217;s and gender history?  What are its shortcomings? What is its future?&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The contributors discuss their discovery of women&amp;#8217;s  histories,the multiple turns the field has taken, and how place affected  the course of this scholarship. Noted scholars of women&amp;#8217;s and gender  history, they stand atop such historiographically-defined vantage points  as Tsarist Russia, the British Empire in Egypt and India, Qing-dynasty  China, and the U.S. roiling through the 1960s. From these and other  peaks they gaze out at the world around them, surveying trajectories in  the creation of women&amp;#8217;s histories in recent and distant pasts and  envisioning their futures. &lt;/div&gt;" />
