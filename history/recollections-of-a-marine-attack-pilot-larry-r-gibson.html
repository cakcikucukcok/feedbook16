  <title>Recollections of a Marine Attack Pilot - Larry R. Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I can honestly say that Mr. Gibsons stories have held my interest and broadened my perspectives more than any novel I have ever read. And I am a serious reader. Marie Gordon, Instructor of Drama and Speech, East Mississippi Community College 
These narratives present in vivid and lively detail many of the incidents and experiences encountered by Major Gibson during his military career. The stories are sometimes poignant and sometimes humorous; but each story presents some insightful lesson Gibson learned about life  even in the midst of war. William Yount, Instructor of History and Philosophy, East Mississippi Community College
From the Marine Corps recruiting office to the challenges of Officer Candidate School; from stateside training as a new Marine attack pilot to harrowing combat experiences during two combat tours of duty in Vietnam; from 3500 hours of jet flight instructor duty to three and a half years as a staff officer at Headquarters, Marine Corps; from nearly passing out while running a sub-three hour marathon to looking back on it all after years of retirement, Major Gibsons recollections continue to rivet the readers attention. 
The stories are absent of technical jargon and yet put the reader into the cockpit during moments of triumph as well as those of momentary fear. Possessing an easy-going and comfortable writing style, the author easily holds the readers attention while relating a wide variety of experiences. The stories provide a valuable insight into the world of a junior officer serving as a combat attack pilot as well as assignment as an Air Liaison Officer to a battalion of Marines in the jungles of Vietnam." />
