  <title>To Secure the Blessings of Liberty: Selected Writings of Gouverneur Morris - Gouverneur Morris, J. Jackson Barlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Liberty Fund is pleased to present this  single-volume collection of Governeur Morris&#39;s writings. This edition  will be a welcome addition to scholars of American and French history as  the volume contains many writings that have never before been  published.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Morris served as Deputy Superintendent of Finance during the American  Revolution, in which capacity he devised the system of decimal coinage.  He was a prominent member of the Constitutional Convention, where he  spoke more frequently than any other member and, as a member of the  Committee on Style and Arrangement, put the Constitution in its present  form and authored its Preamble. As a private citizen in Paris, and later  Minister to France (1789-94), Morris was a firsthand witness of the  French Revolution. On his return to the U.S., he served as a U.S.  Senator, was a prime mover in the creation of the Erie Canal, and took a  leading role as a critic of the Jefferson and Madison administrations.  Providing his unique perspective, this is a wonderful and accessible  single source that illuminates the political and economic thought of  Gouverneur Morris.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Gouverneur Morris&lt;/B&gt; (1752-1816) was a prominent member of  the Constitutional Convention, a signer of the U.S. Constitution and  author of its Preamble, and U.S. Minister to France during the French  Revolution.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;J. Jackson Barlow&lt;/B&gt; is the Charles A. Dana Professor of  Politics and the Director, Program in Philosophy, Politics, and  Economics at Juniata College, in Huntington, Pennsylvania.&lt;/div&gt;" />
