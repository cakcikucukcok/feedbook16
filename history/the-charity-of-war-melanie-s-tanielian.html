  <title>The Charity of War - Melanie S. Tanielian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With the exception of a few targeted aerial bombardments of the city&#39;s port, Beirut and Mount Lebanon did not see direct combat in World War I. Yet civilian casualties in this part of the Ottoman Empire reached shocking heights, possibly numbering half a million people. No war, in its usual understanding, took place there, but Lebanon was incontestably war-stricken. As a food crisis escalated into famine, it was the bloodless incursion of starvation and the silent assault of fatal disease that defined everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Charity of War&lt;/i&gt; tells how the Ottoman home front grappled with total war and how it sought to mitigate starvation and sickness through relief activities. Melanie S. Tanielian examines the wartime famine&#39;s reverberations throughout the community: in Beirut&#39;s municipal institutions, in its philanthropic and religious organizations, in international agencies, and in the homes of the city&#39;s residents. Her local history reveals a dynamic politics of provisioning that was central to civilian experiences in the war, as well as to the Middle Eastern political landscape that emerged post-war. By tracing these responses to the conflict, she demonstrates World War I&#39;s immediacy far from the European trenches, in a place where war was a socio-economic and political process rather than a military event.&lt;/p&gt;" />
