  <title>The Empire Strikes Out - Robert Elias</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Is the face of American baseball throughout the world that of goodwill ambassador or ugly American? Has baseball crafted its own image or instead been at the mercy of broader forces shaping our society and the globe? &lt;I&gt;The Empire Strikes Out&lt;/I&gt; gives us the sweeping story of how baseball and America are intertwined in the export of &amp;#147;the American way.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From the Civil War to George W. Bush and the Iraq War, we see baseball&amp;#8217;s role in developing the American empire, first at home and then beyond our shores. And from Albert Spalding and baseball&amp;#8217;s first World Tour to Bud Selig and the World Baseball Classic, we witness the globalization of America&amp;#8217;s national pastime and baseball&amp;#8217;s role in spreading the American dream. Besides describing baseball&amp;#8217;s frequent and often surprising connections to America&amp;#8217;s presence around the world, Elias assesses the effects of this relationship both on our foreign policies and on the sport itself and asks whether baseball can play a positive role or rather only reinforce America&amp;#8217;s dominance around the globe. Like Franklin Foer in &lt;I&gt;How Soccer Explains the World&lt;/I&gt;, Elias is driven by compelling stories, unusual events, and unique individuals. His seamless integration of original research and compelling analysis makes this a baseball book that&amp;#8217;s about more than just sports.&lt;/div&gt;" />

Robert Elias' affection for baseball illuminates its pages, even when he is unearthing episodes of organized baseball's racism, jingoism, unbridled militarism and insensitivity to other cultures.<br /><b><i>The Empire Strikes Out: How Baseball Sold U.S. Foreign ...</i></b> | "The Empire Strikes Out" is an exceptionally ambitious history of the relationship between US foreign policy and our national pastime. Robert Elias demonstrates that as early as 1888, when Albert Spalding organized a tour designed to thrill people around the world with the game that was increasing his fortune, baseball's relationship to this nation's empire-building was already profitable and mutually satisfactory.<br /><b><i>The Empire Strikes Out - Wikipedia</i></b> | The Empire Strikes Out gives us the sweeping story of how baseball and America are intertwined in the export of “the American way.” From the Civil War to George W.
