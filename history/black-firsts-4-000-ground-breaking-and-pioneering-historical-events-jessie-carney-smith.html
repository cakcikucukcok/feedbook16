This new edition collects and celebrates the thousands of world-moving people and hard-to-find facts and accomplishments that have helped shape society and culture.

Who were the Tuskegee Airmen and why are they so famous? Why was Hattie McDaniel&amp;#8217;s performance in Gone with the Wind significant?
