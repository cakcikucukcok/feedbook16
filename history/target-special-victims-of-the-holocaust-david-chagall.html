  <title>Target: Special Victims of the Holocaust - David Chagall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Before World War 2, there was a total of sixteen million Jews in the world--over one fourth were sephardic Spanish Jews, tracing their ancestral lineage from the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Hitler engineered the genocide of six million Jews, almost all of them Ashkenazic or European Jews, descended from the Khazars, a pagan people from west Asia that converted to Judaism in the 8th century A.D. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Who were the Khazars? And why did their legacy result in persecution and death? Why have the Sephardim called the Ashkenazim &quot;Tedescos&quot;--Teutons? This important book shifts the basic question of the Holocaust from &quot;Why the Jews?&quot; to &quot;Why the Ashkenazim?&quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Challenging the myths of religious bigotry--since the ancestors of Ashkenazic Jews were nomadic Gentile Huns who galloped around the Steppes of Asia at the time Jesus was crucified--TARGET shows just where the true bloodlines of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are centered. On a deeper level, it explores the more complex geo-political roots of anti-Jewish feelings, the amazing number of prominent and influential Ashkenazim, and their role in the emergence of modern Israel. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;	Timely and incisive, TARGET presents new and incontrovertible genetic and DNA evidence that supports a long-overdue examination of &quot;Who is a Jew&quot; and who exactly are &quot;The Chosen People.&quot; Buffered by strong historical evidence and documentation, this is a work that will forever change the way the reader looks at the complex question of Jewish identity.&lt;/P&gt;" />
