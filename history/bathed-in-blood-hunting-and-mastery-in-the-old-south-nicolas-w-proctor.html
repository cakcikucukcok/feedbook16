  <title>Bathed in Blood: Hunting and Mastery in the Old South - Nicolas W. Proctor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The hunt, like the church, courthouse, and family, played an integral role in     southern society and culture during the antebellum era. Regardless of color or class, southern     men hunted. Although hunters always recognized the tangible gains of their mission-meat, hides,     furs-they also used the hunt to communicate ideas of gender, race, class, masculinity, and     community. Hunting was very much a social activity, and for many white hunters it became a drama     in which they could display their capacity for mastery over women, blacks, the natural world,     and their own passions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Proctor argues in Bathed in Blood that because     slaves frequently accompanied white hunters into the field, whites often believed that hunting     was a particularly effective venue for the demonstration of white supremacy. Slaves interpreted     such interactions quite differently: they remained focused on the products of the hunt and     considered the labor performed at the behest of their owners as an opportunity to improve their     own condition. Whether acquired as a reward from a white hunter or as a result of their own     independent-often illicit-efforts, game provided them with an important supplementary food     source, an item for trade, and a measure of autonomy. By sharing their valuable resources with     other slaves, slave hunters also strengthened the bonds within their own community. In a society     predicated upon the constant degradation of African Americans, such simple acts of generosity     became symbolic of resistance and had a cohesive effect on slave     families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proctor forges a new understanding of the significance of hunting in     the antebellum South through his analyses of a wealth of magazine articles and private papers,     diaries, and correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
