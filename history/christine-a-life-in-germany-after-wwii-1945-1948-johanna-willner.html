  <title>Christine a Life in Germany After Wwii (1945-1948) - Johanna Willner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;April 1945. American troops arrive in a small town in central Germany. The war is over. The German people enjoy a new beginning, but not for long. In July 1945 that area is turned over to the Soviets. Germany is divided into four zones. The Soviet Zone is gradually turned into a Communist state, closing all borders, cutting the people off from the non-Communist world. Christine, 16, yearns for freedom  but can she leave her family behind? She tries, in several dramatic attempts, to escape to the free west. Her life is filled with fear. She finally succeeds in reaching the free west.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This story is rich in detail of the post-WW II life in the Soviet Zone, wth flashbacks into the Nazi past, as experienced by a young girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is based on the life of the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany was reunited in November 1989 and Christine finally saw her family again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
