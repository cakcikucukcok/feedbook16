  <title>Hotel Monteleone: More Than a Landmark, The Heart of New Orleans Since 1886 - Jenny Ph.D. Adams, Phillip Collier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From elegant architecture to the familiar faces of employees who have served guests for decades, from the chime of a century-old clock in the lobby to the vintage glow of the neon garage sign, the Hotel Monteleone is iconic to New Orleans and to America, not in one single aspect, but in many. These pages are filled with early historical accounts of the French Quarter and the hotel&amp;#39;s visionary creator, Antonio Monteleone, but they are also packed with humorous memories from notable authors like Richard Ford, Tennessee Williams and Eudora Welty. From Liberace to Louis Prima, from the Swan Room to the famous Carousel Bar, music and celebration are woven in the fabric of this hotel and its story as much as in the town of New Orleans itself. This book is another form of celebration. It&amp;#39;s a testament and a thank you to the cast and characters that have all helped shaped the Hotel Monteleone&amp;#39;s years of amazing history." />
