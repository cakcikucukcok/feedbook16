  <title>Diana Mosley - Anne De Courcy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Diana Mosley was a society beauty who fell from grace when she left her husband, brewery heir Bryan Guinness, for Sir Oswald Mosley, an admirer of Mussolini and a notorious womanizer. This horrified her family and scandalized society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1933, Diana met the new German leader, Adolf Hitler. They became close friends and he attended her wedding as the guest of honor. During the war, the Mosleys&amp;#39; association with Hitler led them to be arrested and interned for three and a half years. Diana&amp;#39;s relationships with Hitler and Mosley defined her life in the public eye and marked her as a woman who possessed a singular lack of empathy for those less blessed at birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne de Courcy&amp;#39;s revealing biography chronicles one of the most intriguing, controversial women of the twentieth century. It is a riveting tell-all memoir of a leading society hostess, a woman with intimate access to the highest literary, political, and social circles of her time. Written with Mosley&amp;#39;s exclusive cooperation and based upon hundreds of hours of taped interviews and unprecedented access to her private papers, letters, and diaries, Lady Mosley&amp;#39;s only stipulation was that the book not be published until after her death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
