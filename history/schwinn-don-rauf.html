  <title>Schwinn - Don Rauf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For many children of the sixties, the gift of a Schwinn was a ticket to freedom, a chance to feel the wind on their face and the steady rotation of rubber at their feet. The Schwinn took many through their childhood adventures, with memories filled of after school, free-range bike rides around the neighborhood with friends, the late afternoon sun shining off of the gleaming painted frame and stainless steel fenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1960s and 70s saw a boom of Schwinn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt; Sting-Rays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which appealed to young riders who had to have the hottest &amp;ldquo;muscle&amp;rdquo; bike in town, and sold like hotcakes to parents everywhere scrambling to get the best Christmas present ever for their kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From its early years dominating the youth market with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Sting-Rays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to the teen-friendly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Varsity &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Continental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; models to its most recent parent-friendly iterations of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Easy-Steer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Roadster Trikes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the Schwinn weaves itself through 120 years of American history.
