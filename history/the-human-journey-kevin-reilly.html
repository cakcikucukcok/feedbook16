  <title>The Human Journey - Kevin Reilly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Human Journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; offers a truly concise yet satisfyingly full history of the world from ancient times to the present. The book&amp;rsquo;s scope, as the title implies, is the whole story of humanity, in planetary context. Its themes include not only the great questions of the humanities&amp;mdash;nature versus nurture, the history and meaning of human variation, the sources of wealth and causes of revolution&amp;mdash;but also the major transformations in human history: agriculture, cities, iron, writing, universal religions, global trade, industrialization, popular government, justice, and equality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In each conceptually rich chapter, leading historian Kevin Reilly concentrates on a single important period and theme, sustaining a focused narrative and analytical perspective. Chapter 2, for example, discusses the significance of bronze-age urbanization and the advent of the Iron Age. Chapter 3 examines the meaning and significance of the age of &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; civilizations. Chapter 4 explains the spread of universal religions and new technologies in the postclassical age of Eurasian integration. But these examples also reveal a range of approaches to world history. The first chapter is an example of current &amp;ldquo;Big History,&amp;rdquo; the second of history as technological transformations, the third of comparative history, the fourth the history of connections that dominates, and thus narrows, so many texts. Free of either a confined, limiting focus or a mandatory laundry list of topics, this book begins with our most important questions and searches all of our past for answers. Well-grounded in the latest scholarship, this is not a fill-in-the-blanks text, but world history in a grand humanistic tradition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
