  <title>Charting China&#39;s Future: Political, Social, and International Dimensions - Jae Ho Chung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;China has scored huge successes during the last quarter century and has already become a global phenomenon. Twenty-five years ago, however, China&amp;#39;s remarkable accomplishments were largely unforeseen. This volume, consisting of nine essays based on &amp;quot;best informed guesses&amp;quot; that are guided by the contributors&amp;#39; concrete understanding of current trends, posits that the future of China is an open-ended question that may not be answered with either a threat or a collapse. All of the contributors provide a set of scenarios and order them in terms of likelihood, including the seven factors they have identified as central to charting China&amp;#39;s future: the Communist Party, local electoral reforms and rule of law, the federalist possibility, social unrest, foreign policy orientations, Sino-American relations, and the Taiwan conundrum. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand China as it rises in power on the world stage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
