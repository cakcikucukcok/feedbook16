  <title>India and Tibet - Sir Francis Younghusband</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the last great imperial adventurers, Sir Francis Younghusband (1863&amp;#8211;1942) was a British army officer whose explorations yielded major contributions to geographical research. In addition to charting a new route across the Gobi Desert, Younghusband was among the first Britons to enter the forbidden Tibetan city of Lhasa, where he headed a 1904 civil and military campaign. &lt;BR&gt;Younghusband&#39;s expedition forms a landmark in British exploration, the culmination of more than 140 years of attempts to establish good diplomatic terms with Tibet. This survey offers an in-depth examination of relations between India and Tibet from 1772 through 1910, the year Tibet was invaded by China. The account focuses particularly on Younghusband&#39;s firsthand observations on the 1904 mission and the treaty negotiations between Great Britain and Tibet." />
