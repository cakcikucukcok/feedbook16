  <title>A Distinct Alien Race - David Vermette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Americans don&#39;t think of Canada as a source of potential terrorists--speaking a foreign tongue, serving a foreign religion, and invading their country. But when a million French-Canadians crossed the border between 1840 and 1930, many seeking work in New England&#39;s burgeoning textile industry, they were cast as foot soldiers in an alleged Roman Catholic plot.
A Distinct Alien Race places these Franco-Americans in the context of contemporary issues: the rise and fall of manufacturing in the U.S.; Nativism and the fear of the Other; emigration to the U.S. across land borders; and the construction of race. Vermette traces individuals and families, from the textile barons whose profits in the Caribbean and China trades financed a new industry, to the rural poor of Québec who crowded into fetid tenements after the Civil War. His social history exposes the anti-Franco-American agitation of Protestant clergy, the Ku Klux Klan, and the eugenics movement.
Author: David Vermette is a researcher, writer, and speaker on the history and identity of the descendants of French North America. He was born and raised in Massachusetts.
Reviews
&quot;the work of David Vermette on the French-Canadians who migrated from Quebec to the United States from the 1860s to the early decades of the twentieth century constitutes the equivalent of a gold mine.&quot; Vincent Geloso, EH.net (Economic History Association)
&quot;First, let me say simply that this is a terrific book, the best synthesis of Franco-American history written to date...Both the research and prose are wonderful...Everyone with an interest in Franco-Americans should read this book.&quot; Leslie Choquette, Résonance  Vol. 1 , Article 24.
&quot;Readers interested in Canadian and American immigration history will appreciate the depth of Vermette&#39;s research and the fascinating story he tells.&quot; Publishers Weekly
&quot;Meticulously researched and overflowing with facts, yet so well written that it&#39;s difficult to put down, the book tells a story few Americans are aware of.&quot; Emilie Noelle Provost, The Bean Magazine (Lowell, Mass.)" />
