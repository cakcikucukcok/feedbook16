  <title>Stalking the Spirit: In a Do-It-Yourself Church - Marjory Zoet Bankson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What happens when a church chooses to subdivide instead of getting bigger? In 1976, the Church of the Saviour in Washington, DC, did just that. Stalking the Spirit is the story of Seekers Church, a second-generation Church of the Saviour community known for its creative worship, open pulpit, shared leadership, strong matrix of mission groups, and generous giving. Seekers Church inherited a tradition of intentional spiritual life (the inward journey) to support ministry in daily life (the outward journey). All members understand themselves to be called and equipped for ministry. As a model for other emerging churches within or outside of traditional structures, Stalking the Spirit tells the story of Seekers Church, whose members sought the Spirit&#39;s guidance again and again for the next steps, both individually and as a community." />
