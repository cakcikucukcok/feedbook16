  <title>Democracy&#39;s Muse: How Thomas Jefferson Became an FDR Liberal, a Reagan Republican, and a Tea Party Fanatic,     All the While Being Dead - Andrew Burstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In political speech, Thomas Jefferson is the eternal flame. No other     member of the founding generation has served the agendas of both Left and Right with greater     vigor. When Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the iconic Jefferson Memorial on the founder&#39;s     two hundredth birthday, in 1943, he declared the triumph of liberal humanism. Harry Truman     claimed Jefferson as his favorite president, too. And yet Ronald Reagan was as great a Jefferson     admirer as any Democrat. He had a go-to file of Jefferson&#39;s sayings and enshrined him as a     small-government conservative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, who owns Jefferson--the Left or the Right?     The unknowable yet irresistible third president has had a tortuous afterlife, and he remains a     fixture in today&#39;s culture wars. Pained by Jefferson&#39;s slaveholding, Democrats still     regard him highly. Until recently he was widely considered by many African Americans to be an     early abolitionist. Libertarians adore him for his inflexible individualism, and although he     formulated the doctrine of separation of church and state, Christian activists have found     intense religiosity between the lines in his pronouncements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The renowned     Jefferson scholar Andrew Burstein lays out the case for both &quot;Democrat&quot; and     &quot;Republican&quot; Jefferson as he interrogates history&#39;s greatest shape-shifter, the     founder who has inspired perhaps the strongest popular emotions. In this timely and powerful     book, Burstein shares telling insights, as well as some inconvenient truths, about politicized     Americans and their misappropriations of the past, including the concoction of a     &quot;Jeffersonian&quot; stance on issues that Jefferson himself could never have     imagined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is one book that is more about &quot;us&quot; than it is about     Jefferson. It explains how the founding generation&#39;s most controversial partisan became     essential to America&#39;s quest for moral security-how he became, in short, democracy&#39;s     muse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
