  <title>The Persistence of Empire - Eliga H. Gould</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The American Revolution was the longest colonial war in modern British history and Britain&#39;s most humiliating defeat as an imperial power. In this lively, concise book, Eliga Gould examines an important yet surprisingly understudied aspect of the conflict: the British public&#39;s predominantly loyal response to its government&#39;s actions in North America. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gould attributes British support for George III&#39;s American policies to a combination of factors, including growing isolationism in regard to the European continent and a burgeoning sense of the colonies as integral parts of a greater British nation. Most important, he argues, the British public accepted such ill-conceived projects as the Stamp Act because theirs was a sedentary, &quot;armchair&quot; patriotism based on paying others to fight their battles for them. This system of military finance made Parliament&#39;s attempt to tax the American colonists look unexceptional to most Britons and left the metropolitan public free to embrace imperial projects of all sorts--including those that ultimately drove the colonists to rebel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on nearly one thousand political pamphlets as well as on broadsides, private memoirs, and popular cartoons, Gould offers revealing insights into eighteenth-century British political culture and a refreshing account of what the Revolution meant to people on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
