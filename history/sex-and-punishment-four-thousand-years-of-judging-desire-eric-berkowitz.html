  <title>Sex and Punishment: Four Thousand Years of Judging Desire - Eric Berkowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The &amp;#147;raging frenzy&amp;#8221; of the sex drive, to use Plato&amp;#8217;s phrase, has always defied control. However, that&amp;#8217;s not to say that the Sumerians, Victorians, and every civilization in between and beyond have not tried, wielding their most formidable weapon: the law. At any given point in time, some forms of sex were condoned while others were punished mercilessly. Jump forward or backward a century or two (and often far less than that), and the harmless fun of one time period becomes the gravest crime in another. &lt;I&gt;Judging Desire&lt;/I&gt; tells the story of the struggle throughout the millennia to regulate the most powerful engine of human behavior.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Writer and lawyer Eric Berkowitz uses flesh-and-blood cases&amp;#151;much flesh and even more blood&amp;#151;to evoke the entire sweep of Western sex law, from the savage impalement of an Ancient Mesopotamian adulteress to the imprisonment of Oscar Wilde in 1895 for &amp;#147;gross indecency.&amp;#8221; The cast of &lt;I&gt;Judging Desire&lt;/I&gt; is as varied as the forms taken by human desire itself: royal mistresses, gay charioteers, medieval transvestites, lonely goat-lovers, prostitutes of all stripes, London rent boys. Each of them had forbidden sex, and each was judged&amp;#151;and justice, as Berkowitz shows, rarely had much to do with it.&lt;br&gt;With the light touch of a natural storyteller, Berkowitz spins these tales and more, going behind closed doors to reveal the essential history of human desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
