  <title>Triumph of Hope: From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel - Ruth Elias, Margot Bettauer Dembo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Triumph of Hope From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel&lt;BR&gt;Now available in English, here is the award-winning and internationally acclaimed testament of a Jewish woman who was taken to Auschwitz while several months pregnant, where she was forced to confront perhaps the most agonizing choice ever imposed upon any woman, upon any human being, so that both she and her newborn infant should not die in a Nazi &quot;medical&quot; experiment personally conducted by the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele. And just as vividly, Ruth Elias recounts the aftermath of her imprisonment, and the difficult path to a new life in a new land: Israel, where new challenges, new obstacles awaited.&lt;P&gt;&quot;One of the most powerful memoirs provided to us by a survivor.&quot; --Indiana Jewish Post and Opinion&lt;P&gt;&quot;Well-written...not only provides a remarkably honest picture of the unspeakable reality of living in ghettos and slave-labor and death camps, but also what it meant to be Jewish in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s...This is one of the best Holocaust memoirs I have read.&quot; --Washington Jewish Week&lt;P&gt;&quot;The understated tone of this memoir adds to the author&#39;s powerful re-creation of her life as a young Czechoslovak Jewish woman during the Holocaust.&quot; --Publishers Weekly" />
