  <title>The State of Ireland - Arthur O&#39; Connor, James Livesay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arthur O&#39;Connor was the most important conduit between French republicanism and Irish political radicalism in the late 1790s ... His State of Ireland, published in 1798, created a distinctively Irish language of radical democracy out of French sources, by fusing them with the local political tradition and Scottish political economy.&#39; So writes editor James Livesey in his introduction to this new edition of The State of Ireland, first published in pamphlet form in 1798 by Arthur O&#39;Connor, a prominent member of the United Irishmen. O&#39;Connor brought to the revolutionary movement of the 1790s a mind honed on the ideas of Adam Smith - ideas that might not seem revolutionary today, but that had radical implications as adapted by O&#39;Connor and applied to the bizarre political economy of eighteenth-century Ireland. As perhaps the most steadfastly anti-sectarian member of the United Irish movement, O&#39;Connor viewed the vexed debates over &#39;Protestant liberty&#39; and Catholic Emancipation as distractions from the fundamental questions of political and economic reform; he supported emancipation as a necessary but by no means sufficient element of a free, democratic Irish society. &#39;What O&#39;Connor&#39;s work reveals to us&#39;, Livesey writes, &#39;is the breadth of vision within the United Irishmen and the novelty of their intervention in Irish political culture ... O&#39;Connor&#39;s text deserves to find a place in the canon of classic political texts that have constructed and made possible, or even imaginable, Irish democracy.&#39;" />
