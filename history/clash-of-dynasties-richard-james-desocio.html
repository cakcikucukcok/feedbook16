  <title>Clash of Dynasties - Richard James DeSocio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Clash of Dynasties: Why Gov. Nelson Rockefeller Killed JFK, RFK, and Ordered the Watergate Break-In to End the Presidential Hopes of Ted Kennedy binds together the crimes of the century. Kennedy had a dream for the nation, but Rockefeller had his own nefarious ambition to be president. Rockefeller employed a staff of seventy, paid for by Rockefeller Foundation funds. Actually, he used his staff to serve the 1960 Kennedy election in the hopes that a Kennedy victory would destroy Richard Nixon as a viable Republican national candidate. However, after accepting his support, the Kennedy brothers turned on Rockefeller who had become a Republican frontrunner in the 1964 presidential race. When the allegations surfaced that Rockefeller was using foundation money, Atty. Gen. Robert Kennedy began preparing charges against the governor with the intent of sinking Nelsons political aspirations. Succinctly stated, Rockefeller beat them to the punch by arranging the JFK assassination, although losing the Republican nomination in the waning hours of the primary. Rockefellers misuse of foundation funds touched off a congressional investigation as well. This sounds very similar to the recent allegations surrounding the Clinton Foundation. Most people will be surprised to learn that the foundation is located on the forty-second floor of the Time-Life Building located in Rockefeller Center. Until very recently, the Rockefeller Foundation was on the forty-first floor. It was Time-Life Inc. that purchased the Zapruder Film and hid it for twelve years. It shows Kennedys head whipping backwards by a bullet strike to his forehead, firmly suggesting a conspiracy.
Representing thirty-five years of research, Clash of Dynasties is much more than a whodunit bookit is about how the Rockefellerocracy still wields malevolent power from behind a secret network of 501(c)3s philanthropic foundationsRockefeller, Ford, Carnegie, etc. Visit rockefellerocracy.com." />
