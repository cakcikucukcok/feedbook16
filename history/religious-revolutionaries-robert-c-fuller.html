  <title>Religious Revolutionaries - Robert C. Fuller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this clever and entertaining look at the United States and religious freedom, Robert C. Fuller introduces us to religious revolutionaries who, in very unique ways, shaped American religious tradition and fought to establish new forms of spirituality. Chronological in scope, &lt;i&gt;Religious Revolutionaries&lt;/i&gt; takes us from Puritanism and Calvinism in America&#39;s colonial period to present-day belief systems. We meet religious rebels who are widely recognized, such as Thomas Jefferson, the architect of our constitutional guarantee of religious freedom. We meet Andrew Jackson Davis, America&#39;s first trance channeler and forceful champion of the inner divinity of every person. We are introduced to Mary Daly, who openly confronted the sexist bias of most organized religion. We also learn about trailblazers such as Phineas P. Quimby, who challenged the Protestant theology of his day and whose ideas became the foundation for Christian Science philosophy, and James Cone, the bold spokesperson for black power and black spirituality. &lt;i&gt;Religious Revolutionaries&lt;/i&gt; is a page-turner that focuses on the people who shaped religion in the United States, but it is also a captivating journey through the history of our diverse country.&lt;/p&gt;" />
