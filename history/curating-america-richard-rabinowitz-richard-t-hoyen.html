  <title>Curating America - Richard Rabinowitz, Richard T. Hoyen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do history museums and historic sites tell the richly diverse stories of the American people? What fascinates us most about American history? To help answer these questions, noted public historian Richard Rabinowitz examines the evolution of public history over the last half-century and highlights the new ways we have come to engage with our past. At the heart of this endeavor is what Rabinowitz calls &quot;storyscapes--landscapes of engagement where individuals actively encounter stories of past lives. As storyscapes, museums become processes of narrative interplay rather than moribund storage bins of strange relics. Storyscapes bring to life even the most obscure people--making their skills of hands and minds &quot;touchable,&quot; making their voices heard despite their absence from traditional archives, and making the dilemmas and triumphs of their lives accessible to us today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rabinowitz&#39;s wealth of professional experience--creating over 500 history museums, exhibitions, and educational programs across the nation--shapes and informs the narrative. By weaving insights from learning theory, anthropology and geography, politics and finance, collections and preservation policy, and interpretive media, Rabinowitz reveals how the nation&#39;s best museums and historic sites allow visitors to confront their sense of time and place, memories of family and community, and definitions of self and the world while expanding their idea of where they stand in the flow of history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
