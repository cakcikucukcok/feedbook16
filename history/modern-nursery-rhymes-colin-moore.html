      <meta name="description" content="Modern Nursery Rhymes
For Grown Ups
Who is &quot;The Song and Dance Man&quot;? 
Why were Dick and Knave fighting?
Who was the &quot;Black Haired Boy living in a bubble&quot;?
Can you solve the mystery of Sammy Strongarm- the man who doesn&#39;t talk?
A book of 56 modern day rhymes and puzzles - how many can you solve?
Who is this?
Little Miss Farmer
Built up her armour 
And up on the screen
She was everyone&#39;s dream
And it seemed that no one could harm her
All rhymes are from 1960 to the present day-give or take a few years!
All the clues are there in each rhyme, see if you can not only work out the meaning behind the rhymes but also the references within them.
Visual clues for some of the rhymes are included in the book but in random places.
