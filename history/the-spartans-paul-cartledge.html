  <title>The Spartans - Paul Cartledge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The Spartans is a compelling  narrative that explores the culture and civilization of the most famous  &quot;warrior people&quot;: the Spartans of ancient Greece, by the world&#39;s  leading expert in the field. Sparta has often been described as the original  Utopia--a remarkably evolved society whose warrior heroes were forbidden any  other trade, profession, or business. As a people, the Spartans were the living  exemplars of such core values as duty, discipline, the nobility of arms in a  cause worth dying for, sacrificing the individual for the greater good of the  community (illustrated by their role in the battle of Thermopylae), and the  triumph of will over seemingly insuperable obstacles--qualities that today are  frequently believed to signify the ultimate heroism. Paul Cartledge is the  distinguished scholar and historian who has long been seen as the leading  international authority on ancient Sparta. He traces the evolution of Spartan  society--the culture and the people, as well as the tremendous influence they  had on their world and even ours. He details throughout the narrative the lives  of such illustrious and myth-making figures as Lycurgus, King Leonidas, Helen  of Troy (and Sparta), and Lysander, and explains how the Spartans, although  they placed a high value on masculine ideals, nevertheless allowed women an  unusually dominant and powerful role--unlike Athenian culture with which the  Spartans are so often compared. In resurrecting the ancient culture and society  of the Spartans, Cartledge delves deep into ancient texts and archeological  sources and complements his text with illustrations that depict original  Spartan artifacts and drawings, as well as examples of representational  paintings from the Renaissance onwards--including J.L. David&#39;s famously  brooding &quot;Leonidas.&quot; This illuminating volume that ties in with the  PBS television series of the same name, airing in the summer of 2003. Booklist  called Cartledge&#39;s The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization, a companion to the PBS  series, &quot;superb,&quot; while The International History Review called  Cartledge&#39;s The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece &quot;an  original and insightful work.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
