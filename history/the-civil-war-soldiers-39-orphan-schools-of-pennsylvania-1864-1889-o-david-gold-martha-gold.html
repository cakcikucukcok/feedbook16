  <title>The Civil War Soldiers&#39; Orphan Schools of Pennsylvania 1864-1889 - O. David Gold, Martha Gold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the only modern, published account of the Soldier&amp;rsquo;s Orphan Schools of Pennsylvania.&amp;nbsp; A bureaucrat of the system wrote a so-called history in 1873 but it is very self-serving and devoid of any critical analysis. Also included, a bonus feature on the Ill-Fated Gettsyburg Orphanage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Soldier&amp;rsquo;s Orphan Schools of Pennsylvania, 1864- 1889 were unique to the history of the nation.&amp;nbsp; They were the first historical example of a government attempting to nurture and educate the children of soldiers killed in war. During the 25 years of its existence, over ten thousand children passed through the Soldiers&amp;#39; Orphan Schools of Pennsylvania.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Established largely through the efforts of Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin, they were not orphanages but privately owned boarding schools funded by the state which took in soldiers&amp;#39; orphans between the ages of eight and sixteen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; While they designed a rigid academic plan of studies, the well-known professional educators who supervised the system for the state were mainly interested in the moral development of these children from the lower strata of society.&amp;nbsp; Discipline, hard work, and obedience were the principal aims of those who ran the schools.&amp;nbsp; Intellectual development was always secondary.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Located mainly in the rural and agricultural areas of the state, the Soldier&amp;rsquo;s Orphan Schools were challenged by the new economic and social forces of the latter nineteenth century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In a state renowned for its savage partisan politics, the Pennsylvania Soldiers&amp;#39; Orphan Schools got emeshed in a so-called scandal which involved the Democratic governor and the GOP opposition.&amp;nbsp; Charges of neglect and fraud dominated the political press for months. This episode of 1886 soured the public on the system of relief established during the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; An add-on chapter concludes the book - The Ill-Fated Gettysburg Orphanage. This institution was like a counterpoint to the S.O.S.&amp;nbsp; The latter was a government sponsored creation.&amp;nbsp; The orphanage in Gettysburg for soldiers&amp;rsquo; orphans was a private endeavor with no government supervision or financial involvement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is truly an amazing story beginning with the battle of Gettysburg, the discovery of a dead soldier clutching the picture of his three children, the search for his identity, the sale of the picture to raise funds for an orphanage, its life from 1866-1877, and its closing largely because of a &amp;ldquo;cruel headmistress&amp;rdquo; who among many &amp;ldquo;evil acts&amp;rdquo; kept her charges in an underground torture chamber.&amp;nbsp; This section features the Lunden Family Letters, printed for the first time. The&amp;nbsp;three Lunden children corresponded with their mother while under the care of the notorious headmistress, Rosa Carmichael.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The book is enhanced by 170 &amp;nbsp;photographs and drawings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
