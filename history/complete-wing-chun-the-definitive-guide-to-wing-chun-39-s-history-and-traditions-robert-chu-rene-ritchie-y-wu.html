  <title>Complete Wing Chun: The Definitive Guide to Wing Chun&#39;s History and Traditions - Robert Chu, Rene Ritchie, Y. Wu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Master the many styles of Wing Chun Kung Fu with this expert martial arts guide.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the fame of Bruce Lee, the conditions in Hong Kong, and the hard work and effort of many of his classmates, the Wing Chun of the late master Yip Man became one of the most well-known and popular Chinese martial arts in the world. Although this gave Wing Chun international recognition, it also led to a lot of misconceptions. Due to a lack of authentic information, many mistakenly came to assume that the renowned Yip Man was the sole inheritor of the style and that his Wing Chun was the lone version of the art.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In fact, there are several different and distinct systems of Wing Chun. Unfortunately, over the years most of these systems have remained unseen or unreported to all but a few&amp;#151;until now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Profusely illustrated with over 300 historical photographs, &lt;I&gt;Complete Wing Chun&lt;/I&gt; presents seldom seen information on a dozen branches of the Wing Chun art. It offers the reader a side-by-side comparison of these arts by outlining each system in terms of history, principles, basics, and training methods.&lt;/div&gt;" />
