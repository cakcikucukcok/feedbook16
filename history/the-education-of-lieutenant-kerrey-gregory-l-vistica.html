  <title>The Education of Lieutenant Kerrey - Gregory L. Vistica</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the night of February 25, 1969, an inexperienced, 25-year-old lieutenant, Bob Kerrey, led a commando raid on an isolated hamlet called Thanh Phong in Vietnam&#39;s Mekong Delta. While witnesses and official records give varying accounts, one thing is certain: around midnight, Kerrey and his men killed nearly two dozen unarmed women and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened that night and why? It&#39;s a terrible secret that Kerrey has borne for more than thirty years. Kerrey went on to do heroic things in Vietnam and later as a politician.  Since World War II, he is only Medal of Honor winner to sit as a member of Congress.  In many ways, Kerrey&#39;s life following that tragic mission has been a struggle for redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is Bob Kerrey a war hero or war criminal? Gregory L. Vistica, who uncovered the Thanh Phong atrocities in a widely-praised cover story for The New York Times Magazine, searches the entire span of Kerrey&#39;s life to answer that question.. From his rural boyhood in Nebraska, to his gut wrenching Navy SEAL training, to his aborted run for President, Kerrey&#39;s life will become a vehicle for understanding the Vietnam generation shaped in the 50s and sharpened by the tumultuous 60s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Education of Lieutenant Kerrey is an incredible story and a modern morality tale about a man of compassion and promise trapped by a horrible secret.&lt;/p&gt;" />
