  <title>A United Ireland - Kevin Meagher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For over two centuries, the &#39;Irish Question&#39; has dogged British politics in one form or another – Northern Ireland&#39;s &#39;Troubles&#39; being perhaps the bloodiest manifestation. And although the past twenty years have seen intensive efforts to secure a devolved local settlement via the Good Friday Agreement, its principle of consent - which holds that the country cannot leave the UK without a majority vote - has meant that the constitutional status of Northern Ireland remains moot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote from the UK mainland in terms of its politics, economy and societal attitudes, Northern Ireland is placed, in effect, in an antechamber - subject to shifting demographic trends which are eroding the once-dominant Protestant Unionist majority, making a future referendum on the province&#39;s status a racing certainty. Indeed, in the light of Brexit and a highly probable second independence referendum in Scotland, the reunification of Ireland is not a question of &#39;if&#39;, but &#39;when&#39; – and &#39;how&#39;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A United Ireland&lt;/i&gt;, Kevin Meagher argues that a reasoned, pragmatic discussion about Britain&#39;s relationship with its nearest neighbour is now long overdue, and questions that have remained unasked (and perhaps unthought) must now be answered.&lt;/p&gt;" />
