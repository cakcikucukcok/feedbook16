  <title>God and the Indian - Drew Hayden Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;While panhandling outside a coffee shop, Johnny, a Cree woman who lives on the streets, is shocked to recognize a face from her childhood, which was spent in a residential school. Desperate to hear the man acknowledge the terrible abuse he inflicted on her and other children at the school, Johnny follows Anglican bishop George King to his office to confront him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Inside King&amp;#8217;s office, Johnny&amp;#8217;s memories are fluid, shifting, and her voice cracks with raw emotion. Is the bishop actually guilty of what she claims, or has her ability to recollect been altered by poverty, abuse, and starvation experienced on the streets? Can her memories be trusted? Who is responsible for what?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At its core, &lt;I&gt;God and the Indian&lt;/I&gt;, by celebrated Aboriginal playwright Drew Hayden Taylor, explores the complex process of healing through dialogue. Loosely based on &lt;I&gt;Death and the Maiden&lt;/I&gt; by Chilean playwright Ariel Dorfman, the play identifies the ambiguities that frame past traumatic events. Against the backdrop of Canada&amp;#8217;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which has facilitated the recent outpouring of stories from residential school survivors across the country, the play explores what is possible when the abused meets the abuser and is given a free forum for expression.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Cast of 1 woman and 1 man.&lt;/div&gt;" />
