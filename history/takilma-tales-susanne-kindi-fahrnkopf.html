  <title>Takilma Tales - Susanne Kindi Fahrnkopf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Takilma Tales: The Hippie History of Takilma, Oregon, explores the evolution of a small village near the former town of Waldo; a Gold Rush ghost town, in remote Southwest Oregon. In the 60s and 70s, young hippies flocked to the run-down mining and logging town of Takilma on the edge of the Siskiyou Mountains, which straddle the border between California and Oregon.  In that wilderness, the hippies transformed the small town, and with hard work and dedication, they created an intentional community, with its own medical clinic, community building, alternative school and food co-operative. This is a collection of stories from Takilma residents and a loose compilation of the history of the place, from Natives to Nowadays; in the words of many of its founding members. The author, herself a resident of Takilma for over 33 years, takes the reader on a fascinating account woven of the memories of numerous free-thinking, New-Age, back-to-the-land people who still reside there. If youve ever wanted to know what the hippie movement was all about; read this book." />
