  <title>The New Instability: How Globalisation, Cloud Computing and Social Media Enable You to Create an Unfair Advantage - Peter Evans-Greenwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Today&#39;s business environment seems to have been turned upside-down. Markets are breaking in two with some companies thriving while others flounder. Black swans – rare, extreme and disruptive events – seem to be occurring every year or so, not every few generations. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the consumer electronics industry where Apple is repeatedly setting record profits, driving it to become one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world while solid, reliable companies such as HP and Sony are finding it challenging to make any money at all. We&#39;re all struggling to navigate our way through this turbulence to find the calm on the other side of the storm. The New Instability shows you why there will be no calm after this storm, taking a practical and jargon-free approach to provide you with the skills you need to succeed in today&#39;s challenging environment. It is a key book to read, to learn from, and, most of all, to change one’s perspective." />
