  <title>Swarm Creativity: Competitive Advantage through Collaborative Innovation Networks - Peter A. Gloor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Swarm Creativity introduces a powerful new concept-Collaborative Innovation Networks, or COINs.  Its aim is to make the concept of COINs as ubiquitous among business managers as any methodology to enhance quality and competitive advantage.  The difference though is that COINs are nothing like other methodologies.  A COIN is a cyberteam of self-motivated people with a collective vision, enabled by technology to collaborate in achieving a common goal--n innovation-by sharing ideas, information, and work.  It is no exaggeration to state that COINs are the most productive engines of innovation ever. COINs have been around for hundreds of years.  Many of us have already been a part of one without knowing it.  What makes COINs so relevant today, though is that the concept has reached its tipping point-thanks to the Internet and the World Wide Web.  This book explores why COINS are so important to business success in the new century.  It explains the traits that characterize COIN members and COIN behavior.  It makes the case for why businesses ought to be rushing to uncover their COINs and nurture them, and provides tools for building organizations that are more creative, productive and efficient by applying principles of creative collaboration, knowledge sharing and social networking.  Through real-life examples in several business sectors, the book shows how to leverage COINs to develop successful products in R &amp;amp; D, grow better customer relationships, establish better project management, and build higher-performing teams.  In short, this book answers four key questions: Why are COINs better at innovation?  What are the key elements of COINs?  Who are the people that participate in COINs and how do they become members?  And how does an organization transform itself into a Collaborative Innovation Network?" />
