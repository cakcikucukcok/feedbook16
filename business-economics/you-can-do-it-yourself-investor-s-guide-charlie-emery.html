  <title>You Can Do It Yourself Investor’S Guide - Charlie Emery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charlie Emery&lt;/strong&gt; has been an active, self-taught investor for over twenty years. &lt;br /&gt;He has invested in his 401k plan at work as well as regular and Roth IRAs. He has learned the hard way, by trial and error, what does and doesnt work. Building on that experience, &lt;em&gt;You Can Do It Yourself Investors Guide&lt;/em&gt; seeks to help todays working investor, most of whom will not have a traditional pension plan to fall back on when they retire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with or willing to learn to work with a spreadsheet program like Excel; you can chart your own investments effectively. By spending a few hours each week managing your own investments and following a disciplined plan of action for your investments, you can plan for your long-term financial health. Emery also provides a top-down plan for the ETF investor who doesnt have a lot of time or money to spend managing their portfolio, along with a bottom-up plan that takes a little more time, but offers better rewards. This helpful guide can help you make your way past the financial planners and investment advisors who promise you big returns, but rarely deliver on their promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can manage your own investments and plan your financial future effectively. The time to start is now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
