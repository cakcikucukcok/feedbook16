  <title>Rethinking Reputation - Fraser P. Seitel, John Doorley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Good public relations is no longer just icing---it&#39;s a strategic imperative more important to your competitive success than even advertising or marketing. This is true whether you&#39;re a century-old multibillion-dollar corporation or a penniless startup. In &lt;i&gt;Rethinking Reputation&lt;/i&gt;, public relations guru Fraser Seitel and John Doorley, founder of the Academy for Communication Excellence and Leadership at Johnson &amp; Johnson, examine a fascinating new set of case studies---including the BP oil spill and the launch of CitySlips---to glean the PR dos and don&#39;ts for the new media world, covering both standard reputation maintenance and crisis management. They also show start-up companies and entrenched organizations how to use the power of word-of-mouth to jump-start business like never before. This is a wake-up call from two industry legends-for public relations professionals as well as entrepreneurs, CEOs, and anyone else tasked with representing their organization to the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These new media lessons include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Remember that research is cheaper, and more critical, than ever. &lt;br&gt;* Don&#39;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good---launch your idea before someone else does. &lt;br&gt;* Don&#39;t get so excited about social media that you forget about traditional media. &lt;br&gt;* In a crisis, you are never offstage. &lt;br&gt;* Never lie, never whine, and never try to predict the future!&lt;/p&gt;" />
