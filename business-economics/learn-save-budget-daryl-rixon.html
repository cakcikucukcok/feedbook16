  <title>Learn, Save, Budget - Daryl Rixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of writing this book is to encourage young people from the earliest possible age and all persons to save some money for the future and to complete a budget as a helpmate. By doing so, your journey through life at different stages should add happiness, satisfaction, contentment, and comfort.
It is hoped that, from the cradle to the grave, one will never stop learning about the values of saving some money each week, accompanied by a budget. We must become conscious of wise saving and wise spending. The school bank, where it is established, is a safe place for the young students to start. For others, it could be another financial institution.
As you are aware, we are turning towards a cashless society. No matter how long we ride this planet, money will be a constant companion and will always be part of us. A budget can be a helper. Changes to our money system in the future is something we all have to live with no matter what.
The world is a school room, life an education. We never stop learningeven about money.
Good advice to help us all is to save some money wisely (and preferably on a weekly basis) and to spend it wisely using a budget as a helpmate.
May reading this book be advantageous and an education about the money you earn." />
