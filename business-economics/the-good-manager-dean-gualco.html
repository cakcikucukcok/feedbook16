  <title>The Good Manager - Dean Gualco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In times previous, managers were respected and idealized by those in the political, economic, and societal circles of our country. Employees felt a sense of trust in their managers, and managers a sense of duty to their employees. That feeling has largely dissipated. An increasing number of books, magazine articles, and newspaper columns have been written denigrating the managerial profession, blaming the average manager for the distrust in our political institutions, the collapse of our economic system, and the stresses in our societal compositions. It is not right, it is not accurate, and it is not fair.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Good Manager: A Guide for the Twenty-First Century Manager&lt;/i&gt;presents the six key attributes of a good manager. The most important attribute  the one that will most likely determine your success or failure as a manager  is the ability to be a good person, one who lives a decent and honorable life, who is incredibly kindhearted, controls the most destructive human emotions, tells the truth, does whats right, and always looks for the good along the road of life. &lt;i&gt;The Good Manager&lt;/i&gt; teaches the fundamentals of management by illustrating how a decent and honorable person can move along the intellectual/moral spectrum to become a good manager." />
