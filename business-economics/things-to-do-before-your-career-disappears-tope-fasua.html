  <title>Things to Do...Before Your Career Disappears - Tope Fasua</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a clarion call. An urgent alarm. It purviews beyond the problem of global unemployment, but speaks to economic and social decisions being made by individuals, households, companies and governments. The author seeks to find an intricate balance in between all of these. At least, if a balance was not achievable, he seeks to add his voice as one of those who pulled back the world from extremism. This time, the focus is on economic extremism. 
As it pertains to jobs, this book tells of the danger of a world where more jobs will disappear than new ones are created, even as population balloons. The factors and forces that will lead to the disappearance of jobs include improved business efficiency (what they teach at Business Schools), increased impatience on the part of entrepreneurs, globalization, the power of big business to crowd out small ones, computerization, robotization, among others. 
Already these factors are asserting their influence and are giving the runners of economies, tough times. The author then advises each of the decision-making units, on the optimal choices they need to make in order to survive the current turbulence, and possibly, the future global meltdown. On the whole, about 80%-90% of jobs in the world are already in serious jeopardy from these factors. It is time to be prepared.
