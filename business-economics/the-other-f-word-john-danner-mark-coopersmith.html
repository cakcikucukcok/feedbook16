  <title>The Other &quot;F&quot; Word - John Danner, Mark Coopersmith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Leverage the power of failure in your organization&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to fail, but failure is a fact of life. Most of us treat it as a regrettable, even shameful, event best overlooked. In truth, failure can be a game-changing strategic resource that can help you and your organization achieve the greater success you crave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Other &quot;F&quot; Word&lt;/i&gt; shows how successful leaders and teams are putting failure to work every day - to re-engage employees, spark innovation and accelerate growth. Authors Danner and Coopersmith - with their rare blend of senior-level executive experience, global advising, teaching acumen and cross-discipline perspective - share these valuable new practices, and show how they can improve results across your organization. Based on exclusive interviews with prominent leaders and insightful examples from their own in-depth work, the book features a practical seven-stage framework to liberate failure as a force to advance your leadership agenda. After all, everyone creates and confronts failure on a daily basis. Why not use it to your advantage? &lt;i&gt;The Other &quot;F&quot; Word&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Start an open, productive conversation about failure across your organization&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reduce the fear of failure that stifles initiative, creativity and engagement&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Anticipate, prepare for and respond to failure, so you can leverage it when it happens&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Harness failure as a catalyst to drive innovation, improve performance and strengthen culture&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Failure&#39;s like gravity – pervasive and powerful. Whether you&#39;re a leader or team member of a startup, a growing business, or an established enterprise, failure is today&#39;s lesson for tomorrow. Let &lt;i&gt;The Other &quot;F&quot; Word&lt;/i&gt; show you how to apply this lesson and take your company where it needs to go.&lt;/p&gt;" />
