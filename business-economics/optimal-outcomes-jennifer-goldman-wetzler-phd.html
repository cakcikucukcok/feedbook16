      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An award-winning conflict consultant offers a new path to take when agreement and collaboration seem impossible, and teaches us that when conflict resolution fails, we can achieve freedom instead&amp;#8212;even without others&amp;#8217; cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A founding CEO and his top salesperson are engaged in a heated clash over her compensation package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mother and daughter are locked in a nasty cycle of blame and attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-profile executive team is struggling with aggressive political infighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, every effort to talk it out has been unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where can you turn when your attempts to resolve conflict fail?
