  <title>Treasury Operations In Turkey and Contemporary Sovereign Treasury Management - Dr. M Coskun Cangöz, Dr. Emre Balibek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has an overall approach to cover treasury operations and aims to provide a comprehensive overview on Turkey&#39;s transformation after the 2001 crisis. In the last decade, Turkey showed a strong performance and was shown as the benchmark country in Europe in World Bank&#39;s &quot;Golden Growth: Restoring the luster of European Economic Model&quot; report. This book not only covers the Turkey&#39;s treasury management experience, but also asserts that the definition and the scope of the treasury operations have changed. Treasury management now involves treasury guarantees, public private partnership projects, non-guaranteed public liabilities and other contingent liabilities, financial receivables and even risk management. The focus of treasury management should cover all financial assets and liabilities within an integrated balance sheet approach. Each article in this book covers a different aspect of new treasury management and constitutes a sub-title of the headline both in terms of content and its order in the book." />
