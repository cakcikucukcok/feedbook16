  <title>A Connected Curriculum for Higher Education - Professor Dilly Fung, Professor of Higher Education Development &amp; Academic Director Ucl Centre for Advancing Learning and Teaching</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to bring
university research and student education into a more connected, more symbiotic
relationship? If so, can we develop programmes of study that enable faculty,
students and ‘real world’ communities to connect in new ways? In this accessible
book, Dilly Fung argues that it is not only possible but also potentially
transformational to develop new forms of research-based education. Presenting the
Connected Curriculum framework already adopted by UCL, she opens windows onto
new initiatives related to, for example, research-based education,
internationalisation, the global classroom, interdisciplinarity and public engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Connected
Curriculum for Higher Education &lt;/i&gt;is,
however, not just about developing engaging programmes of study. Drawing on the
field of philosophical hermeneutics, Fung argues how the Connected Curriculum framework
can help to create spaces for critical dialogue &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; educational
values, both within and across existing research groups, teaching departments
and learning communities. Drawing on vignettes of practice from around the world, she argues that developing the synergies between research and education can empower faculty members and students from all backgrounds to contribute to the global common good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
