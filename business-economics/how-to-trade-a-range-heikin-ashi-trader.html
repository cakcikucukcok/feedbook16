  <title>How to Trade a Range - Heikin Ashi Trader</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;How to Trade a Range&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trade the Most Interesting Market in the World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Financial markets are predominantly trading in trendless zones, which traders call trading ranges or sideways markets. It then appears that they earn money when a market is in a trend and they should avoid trendless markets, because here there is nothing to write home about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite this apparent finding, most short-term trading strategies rely on the trend-following model, although it is demonstrably difficult to implement. Most traders are more or less looking for a bigger move. The experience shows, however, that trading &amp;quot;moves&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;trends&amp;quot; is not that easy. Either the trader recognizes the trend too late, or the movement offers hardly any opportunities to enter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is, however, a specialized group of traders who do not care about trends. They do exactly the opposite. They trade when the market is in a range. This book describes the methods and tactics of these traders. It is not about how to identify a range and then to trade the outbreak from it, but how to trade the range itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
