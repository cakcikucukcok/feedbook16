  <title>Being the Boss, with a New Preface - Linda A. Hill, Kent Lineback</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You never dreamed being the boss would be so hard. You&#39;re caught in a web of conflicting expectations from subordinates, your supervisor, peers, and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re not alone. As Harvard Business School&#39;s Linda Hill and manager and executive Kent Lineback reveal in &lt;i&gt;Being the Boss&lt;/i&gt;, becoming an effective manager is a painful, difficult journey. It&#39;s trial and error, endless effort, and slowly acquired personal insight. Many managers never complete the journey. Often, they just learn to get by. At worst, they become terrible bosses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This essential book, now with a new preface, explains how to avoid that fate, by mastering three imperatives:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage yourself: Learn that management isn&#39;t about getting things done yourself. It’s about accomplishing things through others.&lt;li&gt;Manage a network: Understand how power and influence work in your organization and build a network of mutually beneficial relationships to navigate your company&#39;s complex political environment.&lt;li&gt;Manage a team: Forge a high-performing &quot;we&quot; out of all the &quot;I&quot;s who report to you.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with compelling stories and practical guidance, &lt;i&gt;Being the Boss&lt;/i&gt; is an indispensable guide for not only first-time managers but all managers seeking to master the most daunting challenges of leadership.&lt;/p&gt;" />
