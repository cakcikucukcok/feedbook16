  <title>Opportunism - Shraga F. Biran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this bold and forward-looking book, an Israeli civic leader shows how reorienting our society to make the most of &quot;opportunity&quot; could restore the global economy to health--and give added value to the contributions of the new class of knowledge workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of us, opportunism is a tainted concept. Shraga F. Biran thinks otherwise. He shows that our present economy favors the wealthy few more than at any point in history. But such an economy is both unstable and outmoded, unable to recognize the true value of the work done by the new knowledge class, whose commerce is in ideas, not financial assets. This is why most of us have seen no real gains from the spectacular increases in paper wealth during the past three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biran sees a transformative new way in &lt;i&gt;Opportunism&lt;/i&gt;. In today&#39;s economy, he argues, the way to thrive is to create an opportunity and make the most of it. With great passion, he proposes that we as a society should establish a &quot;right of opportunity,&quot; akin to patents and copyrights, enabling all members of society to lay claim to their ideas and benefit from them financially. Thus empowered, the new opportunists can help bring about a revolution in applied knowledge on the scale of the Industrial Revolution-- and a more just, stable, and prosperous society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
