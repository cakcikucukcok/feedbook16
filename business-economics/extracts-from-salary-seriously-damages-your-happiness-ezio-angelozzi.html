  <title>Extracts From: Salary Seriously Damages Your Happiness - Ezio Angelozzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Inspiration can mean everything and nothing. It can strike or pass unnoticed; yet it goes straight to your heart sometimes, and it can turn into the beginning of a new journey or of an irreversible transformation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ve just been offered a new job. &amp;euro;1.200 a month. Permanent employment. Will you accept it? Let&amp;rsquo;s say that if it can improve your current situation, it could be a good thing, as long as you don&amp;rsquo;t think that it&amp;rsquo;s going to be your job for the rest of your life; that it&amp;rsquo;s not going to determine your future. Why? Just do the sums. No, the back cover is not enough. You need to open the book and dive into it. We promise you two things. One, you can jump without fearing the fall. Two, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be frigging fun. Now, that said, we have good news and bad news. The bad news is that you will become aware of mechanisms that have been working against you, with the aim to enrich someone else. The good news is that being aware of those mechanisms will allow you to obstruct the gearwheel and to have the chance to see things from a new point of view. Maybe your life will change. This book could be the first step. After all, Ezio Angelozzi is an expert in the field, and he can explain things like no other." />
