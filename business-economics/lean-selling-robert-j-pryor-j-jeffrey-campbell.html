  <title>Lean Selling - Robert J. Pryor, J. Jeffrey Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Excerpts of Advance Praise for Lean Selling
Lean Selling is the most important sales management book of the last 25 years. It shows us why 90% of todays sales processes are broken. This book will change forever the way you sell and manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al Davidson  President, Strategic Sales &amp; Marketing, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most sales leaders struggle to get their entire sales team to perform at the level of their A-Players. Too many sales books focus on trying to change a salespersons behavior to achieve this. Robert Pryors book focuses on defining a sales process to yield consistent sales results for your companys product or solution. Lean Selling provides the tools you require to define then refine your sales process as market and competitive conditions change. The end result is achieving both predictable sales and customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Jack  Former Managing Client Partner, Verizon Enterprise Solutions 
Former Managing Director, KPMG Consulting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Pryor has written a book on a subject already covered by tons of books over the years but managed to give it a twist that makes it very engaging and relevant. The book is well written, insightful, and timely; the emergence of internet commerce has had a profound impact on the sales profession as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ake Persson  Retired CEO, Ericsson Wireless Communications, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lean Selling, by Robert Pryor, really woke me up to how complacent some of us are about our sales processes, and how that complacency connects directly to those sub-optimal results. Its a must read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Jeffrey Campbell  Brinker Executive in Residence and Director, Master of Science Program,
San Diego State University School of Hospitality &amp; Tourism
Former Chairman and CEO, Burger King Corporation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lean Selling? I love it. Ive been using lean principles with my inside sales organization for a year now to improve customer fit and the buyer experience. The result has been astronomical growth in sales for my company.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Gaither  Vice president of Inside Sales, ZipRecruiter, Inc.
President, Los Angeles Chapter of the American
Association of Inside Sales Professionals&lt;/p&gt;
