  <title>Planning Plan B - Kylie Parker, Dyan Burgess, Eddie Lees</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is random. For many, life is an enjoyable journey: most of the lows are not too low and most of the highs are compensation for the beige bits in between.

As a sizeable majority of us simply exist without the benefit of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; set plan, it&amp;rsquo;s highly unlikely that we have something remotely resembling a &amp;lsquo;Plan B&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kylie Parker&amp;nbsp;is a mother, a daughter, a homemaker, a professional accountant, a speaker - and now, an author. When Kylie went through a major personal setback, in addition to feeling bewildered and betrayed, she also felt very alone. She had never thought of having a Plan B &amp;ndash; until life instructed her otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of her therapy was talking to others and in this she found that, while her experience was far from unique, the common denominator was that nobody she met had a Plan B either.

Kylie and her experts have assembled insights that will help every person who has the privilege to own a copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; random.
