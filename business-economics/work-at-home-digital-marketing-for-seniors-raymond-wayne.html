      <meta name="description" content="As more and more Baby Boomers retire, a lot of them are facing a key question.&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of Boomers have stashed away enough cash to comfortably support them throughout their golden years.&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, There&amp;#39;s A Huge Chunk Of Senior Citizens Who Have Underfunded Pensions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

To make it easy, I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a step-by-step guide that will show you exactly how it&amp;rsquo;s done...&lt;br /&gt;
