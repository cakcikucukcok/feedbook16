  <title>The Age of Persuasion - Terry O&#39;Reilly, Mike Tennant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Stop to consider the culture of the 21st century: Each morning, you might hear a half-dozen ads on the radio before your feet touch the floor. Staggering out of bed, you&amp;#8217;ll pass brand logos on your clothing and in your bathroom. By the end of the day, hundreds &amp;#151; perhaps thousands &amp;#151; of marketing messages have targeted you. And yet so little is understood about how marketing affects our lives, our society, and our world.&lt;BR&gt;Enter Terry O&amp;#8217;Reilly and Mike Tennant, the ad men behind &lt;I&gt;The Age of Persuasion&lt;/I&gt;, the popular radio show broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Sirius Radio. They have made it their mission to share the back-room story of modern marketing, entertaining asides and all:&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Think of advertisers as millions of ants in a colony, each working hard and each with its own objective. Except that in this colony, every single ant is competing against the others. That&amp;#8217;s the ad business. Almost every ad you see, hear, and otherwise experience is competing for a piece of your imagination. And like any cross-section of humanity, the vast, worldwide advertising community is diverse: composed of geniuses and idiots, saints and buffoons, and everything in between.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;From the early players to the Mad Men of the 1960s and beyond, O&amp;#8217;Reilly and Tennant offer insights into a rapidly evolving industry. Smart and funny, &lt;I&gt;The Age of Persuasion&lt;/I&gt; provides an entertaining &amp;#151; and eye-opening &amp;#151; look at a world driven by marketing.&lt;/div&gt;" />
