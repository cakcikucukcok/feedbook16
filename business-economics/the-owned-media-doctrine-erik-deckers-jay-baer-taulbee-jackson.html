  <title>The Owned Media Doctrine - Erik Deckers, Jay Baer, Taulbee Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Petraeus Doctrine for the 21st Century Marketer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Owned Media Doctrine&lt;/b&gt; is to Marketing what The Petraeus Doctrine was to modern warfare - a complete re-thinking of philosophy, strategy and tactics, dictated by the way war has changed. Just like in warfare, marketing and media is not at all what it used to be - but marketers are still fighting the battle like its 1965.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Owned Media Doctrine&lt;/b&gt; is just that, a new doctrine for Marketing. A new philosophy, strategic approach and operational model for the marketing operations function based on how media works today, and how it will work in the future. Its the marketers field manual for todays two-way, real-time media environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this remarkable  and remarkably useful  book, Jackson and Deckers provide the granular, step-by-step instructions and advice that senior digital marketers have craved for years. This is the book youll keep on your desk forever (or at least until they have time to write the 2nd edition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jay Baer - Convince &amp; Convert &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reis and Trout changed the way we think with Marketing Warfare. Anderson did it with The Long Tail. Jackson eloquently welcomes us to the new age of Owned Media and the reality we face as real-time marketers. An immediate must read....and more importantly, an immediate must do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael Grimes, VP, Omni-Channel Marketing at Finish Line&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in this book just makes so much sense! If the words content or marketing are anywhere in your job description do yourself a favor and read it cover to cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shelly Towns, VP of Product at AngiesList.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Owned Media Doctrine&lt;/b&gt; will show you a future-proof way to advance your marketing efforts based on real-world experience with some of the largest brands on the planet... and it will let the ever-changing media ecosystem evolve around you, rather than the other way around. &lt;/p&gt;" />
