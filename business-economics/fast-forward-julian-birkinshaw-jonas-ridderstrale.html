  <title>Fast/Forward - Julian Birkinshaw, Jonas Ridderstrale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The leading companies of the past twenty years have all harnessed the power of information to gain competitive advantage. But as access to big data becomes ubiquitous, it can no longer guarantee a leg up. &lt;i&gt;Fast/Forward&lt;/i&gt; makes the case that we are entering a new era in which firms that understand the limits of 1s and 0s will take the lead.
Whereas the industrial age saw the rise of bureaucracy, and the information age has been described as a meritocracy, we are witnessing the rise of adhocracy. In uncertain, rapidly-changing times, adhocracic organizations scan the horizon for winning opportunities. Then, instead of questing after more analysis, they respond with agility by making smart, intuitive decisions. Combining decisive action with emotional conviction, future-facing firms seize the day.
&lt;i&gt;Fast/Forward&lt;/i&gt; paints the big picture of a new approach to strategy and provides the necessary playbook to make your company fit for the future." />
