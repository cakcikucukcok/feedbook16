  <title>OECD Development Co-operation Peer Reviews: France 2018 - Collectif</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The OECD&#39;s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducts periodic reviews of the individual development co-operation efforts of DAC members. The policies and programmes of each DAC member are critically examined approximately once every five years. DAC peer reviews assess the performance of a given member, not just that of its development co-operation agency, and examine both policy and implementation. They take an integrated, system-wide perspective on the development co-operation and humanitarian assistance activities of the member under review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review analyses the performance of France, including its efforts towards international stability and climate financing, as well as the impact of the grant-loan composition and the cross-government management of its aid programme.&lt;/p&gt;" />
