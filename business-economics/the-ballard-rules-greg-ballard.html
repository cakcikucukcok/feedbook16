  <title>The Ballard Rules - Greg Ballard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lots of people write leadership books, but Greg Ballard had the confidence to put his own advice into practice personally. This new edition is full of great counsel, all road-tested in one of the toughest leadership challenges our society has to offer &lt;br&gt;-Mitch Daniels, former governor of the state of Indiana and president of Purdue University&lt;p&gt;
Greg Ballard has formulated a remarkable list of rules for successful leadership and demonstrated their validity with historic service as mayor of Indianapolis &lt;br&gt;-Richard G. Lugar, United States senator [ret.]&lt;p&gt;
Greg Ballard was an extraordinary mayor. He was an exceptional leader and served with humility, passion, creativity, integrity, inclusion, and the highest possible aspiration for his city. He did all of this with compassion, kindness, and unusual commitment. He and his wife are great parents and, working together, gave our community terrific leadership &lt;br&gt;-James T. Morris, vice chairman of Pacers Sports &amp; Entertainment&lt;p&gt;
Drawing on his experiences in the US Marines, in the corporate world, as a coach, and as a small-business owner, Greg Ballard now publishes his concise yet definitive guide for new, junior-, and middle-level leaders. In addition to the realities, traits, and principles explained in the book, he also details the two overarching responsibilities of leadership and gives the three indicators of effective leadership. He also explains the relationship between responsibility, accountability, and authority. Additionally included are fourteen other thoughts, which are of great value.&lt;p&gt;
The accumulated knowledge in this valuable book will greatly benefit not only individuals in positions of responsibility but also those companies or organizations that have multiple levels of leadership." />
