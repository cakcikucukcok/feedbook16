  <title>The HP Phenomenon - Charles H. House, Raymond L. Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;The HP Phenomenon&lt;/I&gt; tells the story of how Hewlett-Packard innovated and transformed itself six times while most of its competitors were unable to make even one significant transformation.  It describes those transformations, how they started, how they prevailed, and how the challenges along the way were overcome—reinforcing David Packard&#39;s observation that &quot;change and conflict are the only real constants.&quot; The book also details the philosophies, practices, and organizational principles that enabled this unprecedented sequence of innovations and transformations. In so doing, the authors capture the elusive &quot;spirit of innovation&quot; required to fuel growth and transformation in all companies: innovation that is customer-centered, contribution-driven, and growth-focused.  
The corporate ethos described in this book—with its emphasis on bottom-up innovation and sufficient flexibility to see results brought to the marketplace and brought alive inside the company—is radically different from current management &quot;best practice.&quot; Thus, while primarily a history of Hewlett-Packard, &lt;I&gt;The HP Phenomenon&lt;/I&gt; also holds profound lessons for engineers, managers, and organizational leaders hoping to transform their own organizations.
&quot;At last! The &#39;HP Way, that most famous of all corporate philosophies, has taken on an almost mythical status. But how did it really work?  How did it make Hewlett-Packard the fastest growing, most admired, large company of the last half-century? Now, two important figures in HP&#39;s history, Chuck House and Raymond Price, have finally given us the whole story. &lt;I&gt;The HP Phenomenon&lt;/I&gt; is the book we&#39;ve been waiting for: the definitive treatise on how Bill and Dave ran their legendary company, day to day and year to year. It should be a core text for generations of young entrepreneurs and managers, a roadmap to building a great enterprise.&quot;—Michael S. Malone, author of &lt;I&gt;Bill &amp; Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World&#39;s Greatest Company&lt;/I&gt;" />
