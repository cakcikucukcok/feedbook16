  <title>Timelines into the Future: Strategic Visioning Methods for Government, Business, and Other Organizations - Sheila R. Ronis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Timelines into the Future: Strategic Visioning Methods for Government, Business and Other Organizations argues that foresight is an important aspect of winning in the 21st Century. That includes countries, companies, and other organizations from universities to hospitals to non-profits. If the United States wants a future in which liberty, prosperity and peace are increasing throughout the world, the U.S. must remain a superpower. That requires planning, vision, and a grand strategy. Failure to develop a U.S. vision and national strategy that ensures our superpower status may yield a future where China or another emerging power will dictate the world. Every organization needs a vision, too-every company, non-profit, school, church, and government agency or department, whether they are local, state, national or global. The processes are all generally the same. This book addresses how to go about developing such foresight in establishing a grand strategy." />
