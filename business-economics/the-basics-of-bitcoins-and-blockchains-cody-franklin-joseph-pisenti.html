  <title>The Basics of Bitcoins and Blockchains - Cody Franklin, Joseph Pisenti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dystopian Alternate History: An ambitious feat of engineering and a continent in crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For fans of Philip K. Dick’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Man in the High Castle&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and Stephen King’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;11/22/63&lt;/em&gt;, comes an epic saga by YouTubers Cody Franklin (Alternate History Hub) and Joseph Pisenti (Real Life Lore).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1930’s, architect Herman Sörgel proposes an audacious plan. He wants to drain the Mediterranean Sea by building two of the largest dams ever imagined at both ends of it. The land left behind will become a new continent for Europe, rich in farmland and powered by free hydroelectricity. Sörgel believes Europe can create a modern utopia. He calls this land Atlantropa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peace for the Axis and Germans:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;In this tale of alternate history, that vision is realized. Europe comes together. Sörgel convinces his homeland of Germany that Lebensraum (living space) is not in Poland but in the untapped lands of Atlantropa. World War II never happens. Hitler’s Nazi Germany never collapses. Instead, the decades following the thirties are dominated by the peaceful construction of the dams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the dams are finally finished in the 1980s, something goes terribly wrong. Clara Roux, a French communist gang member, and Robin, the German ambassador to Poland, all stand witness as the promised land unravels and chaos erupts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A dystopian dessert metropolis:&lt;/strong&gt;Two hundred years later, the sea has become a hot vast desert known as the Kiln. Southern Europe is a barren dystopia under the control of Hitler’s thousand-year Reich. Ansel Engel, an Old Reich officer, sails the desert sands supplying Nazi outposts housed in giant structures known as Eagle Nests. He is assigned to the new and enigmatic Eagle Nest #54, near Maria, a vast metropolis and the last large city in Southern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Nazi legacy:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This new assignment forces Ansel to contend with the realities of his world, his nation, and the ideology he grew up believing. Ansel is connected to Clara, Robin, and the past in unexpected ways. As he grapples with a history of race, war, politics, and the rifts they cause, discoveries from the past might just lead him to discover something about his world’s future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantropa Articles&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an astounding science fiction, alternate history saga that will thrill and transport readers with its epic scale and startling intimacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
