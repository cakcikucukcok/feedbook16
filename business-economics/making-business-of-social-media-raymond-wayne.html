  <title>Making  Business Of Social Media - Raymond Wayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagining the Future&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Social media has brought people together in ways that were unimaginable&amp;nbsp; just&amp;nbsp; a decade or so ago, enabling us to forge or rekindle personal connections while presenting affordable possibilities to expand branding, credibility, and influence on a global level.&lt;br /&gt;
Many businesses&amp;mdash;large and small&amp;mdash;are still catching up with technology, looking for ways to leverage these new opportunities and develop strategies to harness social media&amp;rsquo;s potential to achieve their marketing goals.&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s a safe bet that social media platforms will continue to innovate and evolve. The companies poised to make the most of those changes will be ones with flexible strategies that can adapt as tools and user &amp;nbsp;behaviour &amp;nbsp;shifts. Five-year plans are meaningless in the face of disruptive technology that is far from technological maturity. If you want to make the most of social media, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need to learn to go with the flow.&lt;br /&gt;
No one can predict the next social media breakthrough. Yet it&amp;rsquo;s possible to make some educated guesses based on emerging trends and technology. These shifts may have negligible impact on the way some businesses use social media and present enormous opportunities for others.&lt;br /&gt;
It will be up to you to watch for new platforms and capabilities and see the possibilities they offer yet here&amp;nbsp; , this book has already&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; brought&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; all readers&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; to the Forefront&amp;nbsp; of Social Media Advancement ." />
