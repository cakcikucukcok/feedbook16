  <title>Field Guide to Wild Mushrooms of Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic - Bill Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To most Americans, mushrooms are the brown lumps in the soup one uses to make a tuna casserole, but to a select few, mushrooms are the abundant yet often well-hidden delicacies of the forests. In spite of their rather dismal reputation, most wild mushrooms are both edible and delicious, when prepared properly. From the morel to the chanterelle and the prolific and aptly named chicken of the woods, mushrooms can easily be harvested and enjoyed, if you know where to look and what to look for. Bill Russell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Field Guide to the Wild Mushrooms of Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;helps the reader learn just that&amp;mdash;specifically for the often-neglected East Coast mushrooms of the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suited to both the novice and the experienced mushroom hunter, this book helps the reader identify mushrooms with the use of illustrations, descriptions, and environmental observations. Russell&amp;rsquo;s fifty years of experience in hunting, studying, and teaching about wild mushrooms have been carefully distilled into this easy-to-use and well-designed guide. The book is divided into the four seasons, each with its unique mushroom offerings. Each mushroom section includes a detailed description, information about the mushroom&amp;rsquo;s biology, tips on where the mushroom is most likely to be found, and a short &amp;ldquo;nutshell&amp;rdquo; description for quick reference. The book also includes color photographs of each of the mushrooms described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Field Guide to the Wild Mushrooms of Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; shows the reader not only how to identify the most common mushrooms found in the region but also how to avoid common copycats&amp;mdash;and what to do with the mushrooms once they&amp;rsquo;re identified and harvested. With both color illustrations and insightful descriptions of one hundred of the area&amp;rsquo;s most common mushrooms, &lt;em&gt;Field Guide&lt;/em&gt; is an indispensable reference for the curious hiker, the amateur biologist, or the adventurous chef.&lt;/p&gt;" />
