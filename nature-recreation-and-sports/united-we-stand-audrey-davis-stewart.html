  <title>United We Stand... - Audrey Davis Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lester Davis grew up and married Genevieve Holmes who later by the grace of the living God found their place in life. They moved from one small town to another small town. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Lester Davis became coach in the mid-fifties when the schools in the south were segregated and continued his coaching after integration. He like many others felt the sting of a reluctant
spirit that didnt want to change. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nevertheless, he didnt dwell on negative things too much. He pushed forward to victory, after victory with the united community to support his effects. United we stand Divided
we fallAll for one and one for all...F.I.G.H.T...fight! was the teams motto of the seventies, eighties, until nineteen ninety. The motto was all so fitting for some of the battles that were faced by the teams. Really and truly they were in a fight; some were simply to let us know we can win no matter how small. And we did, many times. Coach Davis lead his teams from 1956-1990 to many victories, over 783 winnings." />
