  <title>The Untitled Journals of Steve Donovan&#39;s Marathon Training - Steve Donovan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Steve Donovan liked smoking a lot, but he liked his wife and daughter more. When he started running to help himself quit smoking, he entered into a whole new culture. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Donovan&#39;s competitive spirit leads him to train for the Chicago Marathon to break the four-hour mark. During that time, he kept this diary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The journal entries are humorous, touching and genuine. &lt;i&gt;The Untitled Journals of Steve Donovan&#39;s Marathon Training&lt;/I&gt; is based on events logged in Donovan&#39;s journal from January 2003 to October 2004.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His view of running becomes entwined with his personal life. Running helps him become more insightful about him being his best, but his competitive spirit takes a hit when a life-altering event leads to an epiphany.&lt;/P&gt;" />
