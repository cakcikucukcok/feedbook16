  <title>The Crazy Kid - Homer B. Johnson, Kenny Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Homer  B. Johnson has been a coach in the Garland, Texas, Indpendent School District since 1948 and the athletic director of the GISD sincd 1963. When you coach in one place for that long, you are bound to have a story or two to tell - and Homer definitely has one or two.
As Homer spins through one classic story after another in this book, you will see why he has had the cultural impact that he has had on high school sports in Texas. From a sideline fistfight that fired up future Baltimore Colts star Bobby Boyd, to University of Texas star Marquise Goodwin dominating the high school state track meet wo years in a row, all of Homer&#39;s favorite stories are told here in his down home, unassuming fashion, with some added insight and testimonials from his peers.
If you know Homer or have heard him speak, then you know that his storytelling ability is almost as legendary as Texas itself. If you have not met Homer or heard him speak, you are in for a real treat as you meet him for the first time and relive 60-plus years of Texas high school sports through his eyes." />
