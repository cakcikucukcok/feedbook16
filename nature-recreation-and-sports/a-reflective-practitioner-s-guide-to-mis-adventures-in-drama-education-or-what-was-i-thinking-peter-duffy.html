  <title>A Reflective Practitioner’s Guide to (Mis)Adventures in Drama Education - or - What Was I Thinking? - Peter Duffy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection of essays from many of the world’s pre-eminent drama education practitioners captures the challenges and struggles of teaching with honesty, humour, openness, and integrity. Collectively the authors possess some two hundred years of shared experience in the field, and each essay investigates the mistakes of best-intentions, the lack of awareness, and the omissions that pock all of our careers.&amp;nbsp;The authors ask, and answer quite honestly, a series of difficult and reflexive questions: What obscured our understanding of our students’ needs in a particular moment? What drove our professional expectations?
And how has our practice changed as a result of those experiences? Modelled on reflective practice, this book will be an essential, everyday guide to the challenges of drama education." />
