  <title>God Willing - Mikolai Napieralski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;By 2012 Qatar was riding the crest of a huge and powerful wave. Rich beyond its wildest dreams, the country was leveraging its oil and gas reserves to drag itself into the 21st century. And just like Dubai before it, the country was moving at breakneck speed, trying to cram a century worth of social and economic progress into a short window of opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what the outside world couldn&amp;rsquo;t see, and what the new hotels, shopping malls and construction efforts helped obscure, was the social upheaval taking in Qatar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book captures that brief moment in time - the uneasy mix of money, ambition and religion that all came together when a wealthy, but isolated kingdom, opened its doors to the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mikolai was there for the ride. And this book provides both a historical account of the bright lights and excess, as well as a guide for future expats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re considering a job offer in Qatar, or just want to learn more about the country, this book offers a brutally honest, often hilarious take on expat life in the tiny Gulf state. You&amp;#39;ll learn how to navigate the local bureaucracy, buy a car you can&amp;#39;t afford, drink your way to success, and end up in chartered helicopter with Naomi Campbell. Also, and this is important, how to come home in one piece.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;#39;ve never seen the Middle East quite like this before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
