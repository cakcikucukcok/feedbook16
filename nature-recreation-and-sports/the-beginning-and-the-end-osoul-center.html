  <title>The Beginning and The End - Osoul Center</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, Life: the Beginning and the End, deals with questions of the creation, existence and progress of the universe. This is a subject that has been raised by many communities throughout the ages, yet Islam addressed it in a most direct and clear way right from its earliest days. Islam gives detailed explanations where details are needed and clarifies the issues that need to be clear in people&amp;rsquo;s minds. The Islamic view of this issue is that God is the Creator of the world we know and all that lies beyond it. He is in no need of anyone of His creation, but they all need Him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Belief and good action based on faith and following the teachings of God&amp;rsquo;s messengers will definitely benefit man. In the book, the question is raised of the purpose of the creation of mankind and the jinn. The author responds to this question by saying that the ultimate objective of creation is that all creatures must submit themselves to God and worship Him alone. The author concludes his thesis by stating that all aspects of life in the universe will inevitably end in death, confirming the Qur&amp;rsquo;anic statement: &amp;ldquo;All that lives on it perishes; but forever will remain the face of your Lord, full of majesty, granting grace.&amp;rdquo; (55: 26&amp;ndash;27)" />
