  <title>Cocteau &amp; Feydeau: Thirteen Monologues - Georges Feydeau, Jean Cocteau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Contains original illustrations by Jean Cocteau and Andrzej Klimowski.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two of the seven monologues by Jean Cocteau (1889-1963) in this edition were written for Édith Piaf. The other five were written for Cocteau&#39;s friend, the celebrated actor Jean Marais, to perform on radio. Although perhaps a minor part of Cocteau&#39;s output of films, plays, poems and ballet scenarios, these exquisite miniatures remain a fascinating form of his dramatic expression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Georges Feydeau (1862-1921) is best known for his enduring farces, such as A Flea In Her Ear, yet he wrote over 20 monologues for actors to perform at charity concerts and in fashionable drawing rooms. The six included in this volume were written over a period of 16 years from 1882.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter Meyer&#39;s translations of eleven of these monologues were commissioned by the BBC and performed on radio by leading actors including Eileen Atkins, Jill Bennett, Richard Briers, Judi Dench, Alec McCowan and Timothy West. The Liar and I Lost Her have been newly translated for this volume.&lt;/p&gt;" />
