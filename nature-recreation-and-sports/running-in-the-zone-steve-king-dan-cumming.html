  <title>Running in the Zone - Steve King, Dan Cumming</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Twenty-six runners ranging in age from 46 to 76 share their secrets, motivations and experiences in the fields of running.  All are active runners and many presently hold world age-class records.  Some have held world records and have achieved world level performances at the Olympics, Commonwealth and European games.  But, &lt;b&gt;Running in the Zone&lt;/b&gt; isnt about super achievement, it is about getting the most out the running experience regardless of age or even ability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This book is for anyone interested in running and running-related sports, whether they are elite age-class runners wanting to keep up performances or newcomers, considering taking up running in their middle or even advanced years.  Many of the contributors didnt start running until they were over 40 and some didnt achieve their best personal performances until they were in their 50s.  You will meet men and women who have a life-long interest in running as well as those who took it up as personal challenges.  All are inspiring in one way or another and have something valuable to teach, not necessarily about running, per se, but rather personal satisfaction, giving back through voluntarism and commitment to a goal or purpose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The book was the idea of editors, Steve King and Dan Cumming, and has come together through Steves contacts in the world of running and Dans love of running and editorial ability to pull the best out of a story.  Both Steve and Dan have a long-term relationship with the sport.  They both perceived that a growing number of older runners are involved in the running and that &lt;b&gt;Running in the Zone&lt;/b&gt; would answer many of the needs of this group of active men and women, helping them to get the best out of one of the most fundamental of athletic endeavors.
