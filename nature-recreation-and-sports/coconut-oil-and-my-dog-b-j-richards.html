  <title>Coconut Oil and My Dog - B J Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control doggie odor and fleas, plus heal hot spots, all with one thing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does that work? And what does it cost?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that long term use of chemical laden flea collars can cause seizures? A scary thought I know. But there is an alternative to this problem and many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if there were a way to help your dog with many of the painful everyday issues that come up and do it without the nasty side effects of toxic chemicals? A way to see your dog happy and healthy that was easily affordable and helped to improve the quality of their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many of the products out there today can have debilitating side effects like rashes, chemical burns and seizures, to name just a few. And studies show, the more chemicals our pets are exposed to, the higher the incidence of disease and cancer, just like humans. Without knowing it, you may be adding to the very situations you&amp;rsquo;re trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, there is something that you can do to help your dog without unknowingly putting them through all that. Research has shown, the proper use of coconut oil can help our pets as much as it helps us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this book, you&amp;rsquo;re going to learn:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is in coconut oil that is so effective in helping your dog overcome chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to safely relieve your dog from fleas, ticks, rashes, and obesity, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right kind of coconut oil to buy for your dog&amp;rsquo;s health and why. Using the wrong kind will harm, not help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much coconut oil is safe for your dog to take and how to begin adding it to their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know how hard it can be to find reliable information. It&amp;rsquo;s especially important when we&amp;rsquo;re dealing with our canine friends. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent hours searching the Internet to find solid information for my own pets, and now I want to share that with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing you want to do is let your dog become one of the many victims of today&amp;rsquo;s chemical-ridden society. Now, you have the power to help them avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is for you if you want to do all you can for your dog and ease your own stress at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
