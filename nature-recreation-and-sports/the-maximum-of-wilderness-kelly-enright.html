  <title>The Maximum of Wilderness - Kelly Enright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Danger in the Congo! The unexplored Amazon!&lt;/i&gt; Long
    perceived as a place of mystery and danger, and more recently as a fragile system requiring our
    protection, the tropical forest captivated America for over a century. In &lt;i&gt;The Maximum
    of Wilderness,&lt;/i&gt; Kelly Enright traces the representation of tropical forests--what
    Americans have typically thought of as &quot;jungles&quot;--and their place in both our
    perception of &quot;wildness&quot; and the globalization of the environmental
    movement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the early twentieth century, jungle adventure--as depicted by
    countless books and films, from Burroughs’s Tarzan novels to &lt;i&gt;King
    Kong&lt;/i&gt;--had enormous mass appeal. Concurrent with the proliferation of a popular image
    of the jungle that masked many of its truths was the work of American naturalists who sought to
    represent an &quot;authentic&quot; view of tropical nature through museums, zoological and
    botanical gardens, books, and film. Enright examines the relationship between popular and
    scientific representations of the forest through the lives and work of Martin and Osa Johnson
    (who with films such as &lt;i&gt;Congorilla&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Simba&lt;/i&gt; blended
    authenticity with adventure), as well as renowned naturalists John Muir, William Beebe, David
    Fairchild, and Richard Evans Schultes. The author goes on to explore a startling shift at
    midcentury in the perception of the tropical forest--from the &quot;jungle,&quot; a place that
    endangers human life, to the &quot;rain forest,&quot; a place that is itself
    endangered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
