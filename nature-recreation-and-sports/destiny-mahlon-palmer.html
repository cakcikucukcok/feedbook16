  <title>Destiny - Mahlon Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was written primarily for those young people, both boys and girls and their parents and/or mentors who, for whatever reason, believe they have no chance at a successful life. This book is the story about a young boy who believed he was in that category while growing up. I hope you will continue reading to see how that little boy changed those odds and ultimately did many things that most people cannot even dream of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many children that are born into poverty and thus have no apparent reason to try to succeed. That was the case with Mahlon Dick Palmer. Dick was the youngest of four boys and was certainly not a welcome addition to the Palmer family. Keep in mind, he was born in the midst of the greatest depression the country has ever experienced, thus another mouth to feed and clothe was not a welcome addition. There was one positive benefit though; this child did provide a cheap source of labor. As you will discover, Dick was expected to work twelve- to fourteen-hour days every day until he left home to join the air force when he was seventeen years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the grace of God, Dick somehow graduated from high school since he never once, in twelve years, ever had any time to do homework. If he didnt get it in class, he just didnt get it. Dicks high school graduation present was the view of the closing door behind him as he was on his way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dicks very best childhood friend was his Dog King who is on the cover of this Book. Without King, Dicks childhood would have been very, very difficult, for they were always together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life was about to change dramatically when Dick joined the air force when he was seventeen years old. The title of the book, Destiny, is very appropriate since it was at that time when destiny played a major role in Dicks life. Dick should have never passed his induction physical (due to an unknown severe bundle branch blockage in his heart), but he did; he should have never been accepted in the Air Forces air weather school, but he was, graduating forty-third out of a class total of 187. He remained in the air force for a total of four years. In his book, Dick discusses many more pivotal events where destiny played a major role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is in the book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
