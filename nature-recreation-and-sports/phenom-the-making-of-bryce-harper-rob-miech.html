  <title>Phenom: The Making of Bryce Harper - Rob Miech</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;The remarkable story of Bryce Harper&#39;s unforgettable ride from Morse Stadium to the top of the baseball draft&quot; (Jayson Stark, ESPN.com) updated from the hardcover edition (&lt;i&gt;The Last Natural) &lt;/i&gt;to include his Rookie of the Year season!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before he famously became a Major League All-Star as a teenager, Harper already had dominated high school competition like Mickey Mantle on the playground and appeared on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/i&gt;, which dubbed him the &quot;most exciting prodigy since LeBron James.&quot; Seeking greater tests as a hitter, the precocious star got his GED after his sophomore year and enrolled at the College of Southern Nevada, where he would face future pro pitchers in a difficult wooden-bat league. Sportswriter Rob Miech was &quot;embedded&quot; with the team--in the dugout and locker room and on team buses and in motel rooms--to provide a warts-and-all account of a boy among men playing like a man among boys. Amid fascinating personal stories including the dynamics between a veteran coach and Harper&#39;s overprotective father, the jealousies of teammates and opponents, and the sudden descent of press armies on a tiny college field, the author chronicles a season-long experiment that culminates in Harper leading the Coyotes to the Junior College World Series and signing a $9.9 million contract negotiated by notorious agent Scott Boras. Sporting a fresh cover and a bonus chapter that covers Harper&#39;s award-winning rookie season with the Washington Nationals, this expanded edition of &lt;i&gt;Phenom&lt;/i&gt; (originally published as &lt;i&gt;The Last Natural&lt;/i&gt;) gives fans an all-access pass to baseball&#39;s newest rising star.&lt;/p&gt;" />
