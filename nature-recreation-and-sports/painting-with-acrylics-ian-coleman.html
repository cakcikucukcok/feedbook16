  <title>Painting with Acrylics - Ian Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Acrylics are a versatile and exciting medium, but how can you get the most from these paints? This book shows you how. With step-by-step examples, it explains the core brush skills for a beginner. For those with more experience, it introduces a range of techniques so you can learn, for example, how to blend your colours, use transparent washes to create tones, and paint multiple layers of thick and thin textures to give your work subtlety. The paints are so forgiving that there are no rules, just opportunities to have fun and experiment with their great potential. There are eleven classic paint techniques featured. With Ian&#39;s clear instruction, this book guides you through the principles of handling the paint, which can be applied to any style of painting, however loose, expressive or abstract it may be. With focus on brush skills to achieve a range of styles and finishes and a range of examples, including people, still life, abstract and animals this clear, instructional guide will be of interest to artists wanting to learn acrylics, and those interested in graphic design, commercial illustration and natural history. Beautifully illustrated with 127 colour images." />
