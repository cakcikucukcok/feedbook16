  <title>Step-by-step development of initial actions after a fast throw-off (TU 19) - Jörg Madinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The objective of this training unit is to develop a simple initial action after a fast throw-off. Following warm-up and a coordination run exercise, the players practice the basics during the ball familiarization phase and the goalkeeper warm-up shooting. During the three subsequent exercises, the players further develop the running and passing paths and eventually combine them in order to create an initial action. In the closing game, the players implement what they practiced before.
The training unit consists of the following key exercises:
- Warm-up/Stretching (individual exercise: 10 minutes/total time: 10 minutes)
- Coordination run (10/20)
- Ball familiarization (10/30)
- Goalkeeper warm-up shooting (10/40)
- Offense/Small groups (10/50)
- Offense/Team (15/65)
- Offense/Team (15/80)
- Closing game (10/90)
Training unit total time: 90 minutes
Difficulty: High level (youth teams under 17 years of age and adult teams)" />
