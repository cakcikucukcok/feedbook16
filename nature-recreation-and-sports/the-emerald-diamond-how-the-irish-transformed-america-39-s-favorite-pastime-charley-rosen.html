  <title>The Emerald Diamond: How the Irish Transformed America&#39;s Favorite Pastime - Charley Rosen</title>

From early discrimination to later domination, from Mike Kelly, a society star in the 1880s, to the managerial fame of Connie Mack (n&amp;#233; McGillicuddy), early Irish players and managers helped shape the game of baseball in every way.

Just a few of the great Irish athletes featured as well are Mickey Cochrane (for whom Mickey Mantle was named); Charles Comiskey; Ed Walsh, the last pitcher to win 40 games in a single season; and Ed Delahanty, whose prodigious life and mysterious death continue to be a source of intrigue.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With decade-by-decade profiles of exciting Irish figures on the field and off,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Emerald Diamond&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;also offers important discussion on cultural and political themes relevant to their times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
