  <title>The Golf Swing Simplified - Steven Carroll, Lorna Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s the simplification of The Golf Swing that constitutes the chief claim of this vintage little work to a place on the 21st century golfer&#39;s bookshelf still. The complexity of the golf swing has arisen largely as the result of the imperfect appreciation of the influence of the wrists in the execution of the movements of the club. Confusion, too, has been introduced by the inaccurate terminology that is usually employed in the description of the &quot;so-called&quot; action of the wrists. The object of this book is to show that the mechanism of the golf swing depends on &quot;forearm,&quot; rather than on &quot;wrist,&quot; action. The proof of this proposition is set out in the following pages. Timeless need-to-know instruction for any of today&#39;s golfers keen to improve their golf swing and so then thus improving their game." />
