  <title>Distance Memories - Scott Ludwig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Ive been around the block a few times.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Over half a million times, actually.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Assuming a block is approximately 100 yards long and 100 yards wide, running just over 130,000 lifetime miles equates to a few more than 500,000 times around the block.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;So yeah, Ive been around the block a few times.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ive had my share of ups and downs. The Boston Marathon, the Badwater Ultramarathon and having whatever it takes to run every single day since November 30, 1978 would fall into the former; an aging body, injuries, andwell, to be totally honest falling down while running much too often these days would fall into the latter.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But its been a good, long run and I wouldnt have wanted it any other way.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My wife Cindy believes the 2003 Badwater Ultramarathon signaled the beginning of my declining health and running ability. I beg to differ: I believe it was my (last place, and darn proud of it) finish in the 2006 Western States Endurance Run that catapulted me into the downside of my running career.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;However, I have no regrets. As I said earlier its been a good, long run and I wouldnt have wanted it any other way.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Besides, if it had been any other way I wouldnt have had the many tales you will find in this book that you, quite frankly, could not possibly find anywhere else.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These are my stories frommy experiencesand my perspectives on running as well as life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Theyre all absolutely true. Theyre all brutally honest. Theyre all from the heart.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most of all, theyre all mine.&lt;/P&gt;
