  <title>Twelve Days to Save Christmas - Jane Finch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Magical Mary arrives in Berryfield with with two missions. The first is to bring Christmas back to the town, and the second is to help Esme, a Foundling and a child who does not speak, to achieve her destiny and save Christmas for the town. Mary has to enlist the help of the mysterious Jane and convince her of the role she needs to play to ensure Mary&amp;rsquo;s missions are fulfilled. The town Mayor has nothing but bad memories of Christmas and has kept the Christmas spirit from the town for so long that the people of Berryfield have forgotten what Christmas is all about. Can Mary and Imi the elf convince Jane to change the mind of the mean-minded Mayor, help the struggling family, and bring Christmas back to the town? Readers Favorite Five Star Review: Grange Solicitors has never decorated its office for Christmas - no tree, no lights, no trimmings. In fact, the entire town of Berryfield has banned Christmas. You see, the mayor of Berryfield is a non-believer, a miserable old Scrooge who doesn&amp;#39;t believe in celebrating anything, let alone Christmas. So when Jane, who works at Grange Solicitors, and Mary, the cleaning lady, team up to decorate the office...s, the mayor notices too much happiness and sets about making everyone&amp;#39;s life miserable. How? He bans pets of any kind from family homes. The town&amp;#39;s inhabitants are unhappy and very angry, but not as much as Jane, who sets about making things right for not only the town, but also the miserable old mayor. You see, Jane is on a special mission, and Mary, who is a Finder, helps her. Their ultimate goal is to save Christmas and there&amp;#39;s little time left to do so. Jane Finch&amp;#39;s young people&amp;#39;s story, Twelve Days to Save Christmas, is a wonderful fable, a charming story for young readers about Christmas and the power of love and faith. She takes on the classic theme of a Scrooge-type character and expounds on the true meaning of the season. Each character has its place in the story, its place in life itself, and they all blossom with the unveiling of the magic of Christmas. This is more than a tale of Christmas miracles; it&amp;#39;s a story with the power to change and make things right in the world, starting with making Christmas right. Very well done!&lt;/p&gt;" />
