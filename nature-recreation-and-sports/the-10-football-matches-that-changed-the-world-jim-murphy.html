  <title>The 10 Football Matches That Changed the World - Jim Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;The assertion that &amp;amp;#145;football isn&amp;amp;#8217;t a matter of life or death, it&amp;amp;#8217;s much more important than that&amp;amp;#8217; has been verified repeatedly throughout modern history. It has bolstered tyrants and helped depose them; contributed to conflict and created ceasefires. It has been an incubator of racism at home and helped bring down a racist regime abroad; shaped cities, changed cultures and inspired resistance. Its impact is as dynamic as the game itself. In this fascinating exploration, Jim Murphy takes us on a journey around the world and through the years, from Franco&amp;amp;#8217;s Spain to Africa&amp;amp;#8217;s Alcatraz, Robben Island. Charting the match that sparked a Central American war, the Barcelona team threatened at gunpoint, and the game that helped save Rupert Murdoch&amp;amp;#8217;s media empire, among much else, Murphy lends a fresh new perspective to some of the most iconic moments in international football. Blending a love of the game with an appreciation of its place in global events, this is an authoritative and often humorous mix of sport and history, featuring fascinating first-hand insights from those most involved in the ten matches that changed the world &amp;amp;#133; and the one that didn&amp;amp;#8217;t.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
