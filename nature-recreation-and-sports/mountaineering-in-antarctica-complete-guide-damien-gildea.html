  <title>Mountaineering in Antarctica: complete guide - Damien Gildea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;For the first time the peaks and ranges of the world&#39;s wildest continent in one place for all to see!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This beautiful work is dedicated to mountain addicts and to amateurs who like to travel far from home, avid for discovering  our planet&#39;s rare regions, which are still little known.&lt;br&gt;Climbing Antarctica is a unique experience. It is a dream that only few mountaineers have had the privilege to fulfill and that you can now skim, thanks to this very nice book, richly illustrated and remarkably documented.&lt;br&gt;Damien Gildea will let you get be dragged into the rich history of Antarctica mountaineering adventure, from the first explorations in the 19th century until the achievements of today extreme climbers. He will lead you at the very heart of the most impressive and remote mountains of the South Pole…&lt;br&gt;Discovering the incredible Antarctica Mountains, emerging from the white hugeness, will let more than one reader speechless. It is hard to figure out that we are still on Earth!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is an absolute must-have for all climbers and travellers!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damien Gidea is a polar mountaineer and explorer. He successfully led seven expeditions in the highest Antarctica Mountains, from 2001 to 2008. He is the author of the book entitled &lt;i&gt;Antarctic Mountaineering Chronology&lt;/i&gt;, published in 1998, and of detailed topographical maps of the Livingston Island (2004) and Vinson Mountain (2006). His articles and photographs were published in many periodicals around the world, as the American Alpine Journal or the American magazine called Alpinist. He also led a skiing expedition to the South Pole and took part in several expeditions in the Himalayas, in Karakorum and in the Andes. When he is not exploring, Damien Gildea lives in Australia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXCERPT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introduction &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climbing in Antarctica is a special experience that never fails to affect those fortunate enough to do it. For most of Antarctica’s human history this experience was restricted to those who worked as part of national government Antarctic programs, requiring great financial and logistical efforts. Visitors – and in Antarctica we are all visitors – were a small cog in a vast scientific and political machine. The scope and quality of work done by these programs has been incredible and continues to be so, providing us with critical insights into not only Antarctica but also our world as a whole. However, in purely mountaineering terms, the activity of such operations was understandably limited. Mountaineering merely enabled scientific work, with recreational climbing discouraged and usually unrecorded. In the following pages I?hope to preserve at least some of those ascents, as often they have proven to be more significant to those involved than the official scientific record may indicate, and they are part of the rich human history of Antarctica that should be recorded for all to enjoy." />
