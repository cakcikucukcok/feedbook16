&lt;p&gt;Praise for On the Golf Course: 101 Ways to Rock Your World &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Each year, I host the Reader Cup Golf Tournament for literacy. When Dayna started playing with us, she was awful. Now she&#39;s moved up to mediocre! Seriously, this is a must-read for any golfer-humor, great tips, and ideas that will really change your game for the better&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
-Larry Dierker, Houston Astros special assistant and #49 retired; author of This Ain&#39;t Brain Surgery and My Team &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dayna has absolutely captured a great deal of the &#39;flavor&#39; of this great game in this book. If you have ever played the game with any degree of sincerity, the book will remind you of the exhilarating successes, beauty, and humor that only the game of golf can provide in abundance&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
-Hal Underwood, professional golfer and the inspiration behind the film &quot;Tin Cup&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
