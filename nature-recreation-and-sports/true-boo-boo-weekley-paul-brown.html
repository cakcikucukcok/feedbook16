  <title>True Boo - Boo Weekley, Paul Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;From the deep South to the PGA Tour, the hilarious and inspiring memoir of golfer Boo Weekley &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;Ever since his breakout performance at the 2008 Ryder Cup, professional golfer Thomas Brent Weekley, known affectionately as &quot;Boo,&quot; has captivated fans with his eccentric, Southern-fried country humor and incredible path to the top of the PGA Tour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;True Boo &lt;/I&gt;is the candid and often hilarious memoir of a larger-than-life athlete, and a wild behind-the-scenes look at life on the PGA Tour. Boo takes readers on a rollicking journey that begins with his humble childhood growing up in Milton, Florida. Called &quot;a nobody from nowhere&quot; and the &quot;Crocodile Dundee of golf,&quot; Boo had to earn respect on the Tour. His game ascended in record time, culminating in his now legendary Ryder Cup victories--going 2-0-1 in his three matches--and his back-to-back Verizon Heritage wins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With stories of his personal relationships with other players on tour including Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, frequent down-home phrases, figures of speech, locker-room language, plenty of &quot;Booisms&quot; and never-before-seen photos, this is a golf book unlike any other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
