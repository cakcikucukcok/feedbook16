  <title>The Search for the Flat Ness Monster - Ron Whittaker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When he first began the ICT, Ron envisioned that it would take from five to ten years to complete the trail. He had the feeling that when he signed up for his first ICT hike that he was about to step into the company of some elite hikers. It was very humbling for him to struggle along for thirteen miles that day, always the last one down the trail, trying to catch up to the others. Asthma made him much slower than most hikers. As his journey progressed, he met another hiker who was on the same quest. Together, they hiked about half of Idaho. He had much to learn about traveling in wilderness areas. Over time, his conditioning, skills, and confidence improved, and he began to venture on solo hikes. His journey across Idaho was not a continuous line of progress. He completed the trail in the most random and hopscotch fashion that one could imagine. Along the way, there were many interesting experiences and encounters, including a near fatal slide in the snow that almost ended the quest. Despite sometimes slow progress, frustrating setbacks, and physical limitations, he was able to experience the diverse and incredibly beautiful state of Idaho, with its ever changing topography and climate. He traveled the high deserts of the south, the Snake River plains, the Sawtooth Wilderness, the massive Salmon River canyon, the Gospel Hump Wilderness, the highlands of the Idaho-Montana Stateline Trail, the panhandle territory, the Selkirk range, the shores of Priest Lake, and arrived at last at Upper Priest River waterfall. It was a defining journey for Ron. He highly recommends the Idaho Centennial Trail to any prospective person who is considering either a thru-hike or a project of several years." />
