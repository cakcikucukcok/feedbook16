  <title>The Chelsea Green Reader: Selections from 30 Years of Independent Publishing, 1984-2014 - Ben Watson, Ian Baldwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chelsea Green, the Vermont-based independent publisher, has always had a nose for authors and subjects that are way ahead of the cultural curve, as is evident in this new anthology celebrating the company&#39;s first thirty years in publishing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The more than one hundred books represented in this collection reflect the many distinct areas in which we have published-from literature and memoirs to progressive politics, to highly practical books on green building, organic gardening and farming, food and health, and related subjects-all of which reflect our underlying philosophy: &quot;The politics and practice of sustainable living.&quot; &lt;em&gt;The Chelsea Green Reader&lt;/em&gt; offers a glimpse into our wide-ranging list of books and authors and to the important ideas that they express. Interesting and worth reading in their own right, the individual passages when taken as a whole trace the evolution of a highly successful small publisher-something that is almost an oxymoron in these days of corporate buyouts and multinational book groups.&lt;br /&gt;  From the beginning, Chelsea Green&#39;s books were nationally recognized, garnering positive reviews, accolades, and awards. We&#39;ve published four &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestsellers, and our books have set the standard for in-depth, how-to books that remain relevant years-often decades-beyond their original publication date.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &quot;Chelsea Green was born from a single seed: the beauty of craft. Craft in writing and editing, in a story well told, or a thesis superbly expressed,&quot; writes cofounder and publisher emeritus Ian Baldwin in the book&#39;s foreword. Today, craft continues to inform all aspects of our work-design, illustration, production, sales, promotion, and beyond. It has even informed our business model: In 2012, Chelsea Green became an employee-owned company.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With the rise of the Internet, new media platforms, and a constantly shifting bookselling landscape, the future of publishing is anything but predictable. But if Chelsea Green&#39;s books prove anything, it is that, despite these challenges, there remains a hunger for new and important ideas and authors, and for the permanence and craftsmanship of the printed word. Today our ongoing mission is stronger than ever, as we launch into our next thirty years of publishing excellence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
