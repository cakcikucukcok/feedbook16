  <title>Microscopy of Positive Living - BALDEV BHATIA</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Art of Positive Living is not a complicated kind of art difficult to learn rather a simple art of positive thinking, living well, eating well, thinking well and feeling well. What we need to do is just to tune up our mind to enjoy every moment of life and let the positive happiness follow us. This is something that needs to be looked into thoroughly. 
We need to focus on the positive aspects lives, rather than on the negative setbacks. We ought to remember, only the positive living can bring happiness in our lives. Let us find something good even in most critical moments of our life and let us make positive living the basis of our happy living.  Its a matter of thought that fools worry about the circumstances on which they have no control. Why worry when we cannot change the weather, rather enjoy it whether its hot, humid,and hazy. 
The Authors main object and message, through this manuscript to his readers is to spread, Peace, Love and Happiness to the entire world as he tries to guide his readers to ward off negativity, depression, dejection and hatred among them. 
The astrologer has been associated with the general public for the past forty five years and has been practicing Astrology in various forms. His advice, remedies and predictions have been very useful, purposeful, and a pin point to the service of mankind. He wishes success for all his readers.
