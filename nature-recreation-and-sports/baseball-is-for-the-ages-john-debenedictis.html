  <title>Baseball Is for the Ages - John DeBenedictis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is not the book to read if you are interested in a literary masterpiece. The authors career was in Biomedical Engineering. As a result, the book probably reads more like an engineering report than anything else. If you are interested in what motivates men from 50 to 90 years of age to sacrifice their summer weekends to get back on the baseball diamond with all the associated aches and pains (physical as well as spousal), you may very well enjoy this book. Why would an adult lose 20 to 70 pounds in one year? Why would someone with multiple heart attacks and as many as eight stents in their coronary arteries play doubleheaders on a hot summer day in August (especially if he is a pitcher and a catcher)? Why would an intelligent adult with both hips and both knees replaced play baseball Saturday and Sunday, as well as one or two nights during the week? If you are interested in starting a league like that, you may also learn what it takes to make it happen. Bonus information? Check out why this league has been credited with leveling the playing field between men and women! Baseball truly is for the ages Enjoy." />
