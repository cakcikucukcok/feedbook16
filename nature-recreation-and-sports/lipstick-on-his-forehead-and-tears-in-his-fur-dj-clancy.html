  <title>Lipstick on His Forehead and Tears in His Fur - Dj Clancy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is not just a story about an extraordinary dog; this is a story of an extraordinary journey of two souls who found each other again, connecting in a special way. It is a celebration of his life as a therapy dog, the job he had to do, and how he chose me to help him succeed. He had an amazing ability to sense when someone was in pain, as well as having a sense of humor. I was blessed to notice this special gift in him early and am honored that I could provide an avenue for him to meet many people who just needed some unconditional love. This is from my heart to yours.
Laugh, cry and enjoy our adventures." />
