  <title>Painting Rivers from Source to Sea - Rob Dudley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rivers can be enchanting or exciting, but are always absorbing.  They provide a myriad of painting opportunities and challenges for the artist.  Focusing on watercolour - one of the most direct of mediums - this practical book explains how to paint a river and capture its life, light, movement, colour and interest.  With over 200 colour images, Rob Dudley shares his methods, techniques and ideas to make this beautiful book a must-have for all landscape and en plein-air artists. It explains each stage of a painting; inspiration and focus, sketching and information gathering, planning and painting; and advises on how to paint water so that it captures the colour, shape and tone of light and reflections. It also looks at the various moods and characters of rivers - from the early streams and cascades through to strong, busy waterways and finally to the tidal estuary, where the river meets the sea, and instructs on how to bring a painting to life by including the features of a river - the boats, wildlife, people and bridges. Finished paintings, examples and step-by-step sequences are used throughout to support the detailed instruction. Beautifully illustrated with 233 colour images." />
