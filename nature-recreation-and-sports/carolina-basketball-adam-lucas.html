  <title>Carolina Basketball - Adam Lucas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Boasting six national championships and scores of Hall of Fame coaches and players, Carolina Basketball has come a long way from the first season--when the campus newspaper published a notice asking an unknown culprit to return the team&#39;s basketball. These pages are packed with little-known stories from the program&#39;s earliest days and new insights into its best-loved moments. All the greats are here, from Jack Cobb and the &quot;Blind Bomber&quot; George Glamack to Lennie Rosenbluth, Phil Ford, James Worthy, Michael Jordan, Antawn Jamison, and Tyler Hansbrough. Lucas reveals the meaning of the &quot;Carolina family&quot; and the origins and evolution of Tar Heel traditions that have made North Carolina one of the premier teams in men&#39;s college basketball.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These stories are brought to life with more than 175 color and black-and-white photos; a foreword by Hall of Fame coach Dean Smith and an afterword by fellow Hall of Famer Roy Williams; and an appendix of records and statistics. Some 25 sidebars feature first-person recollections from prominent players, including Rosenbluth, Ford, and Jordan; opposing coaches like Lefty Driesell; and famous alumni like Peter Gammons and Alexander Julian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the must-have book for Tar Heel fans and college basketball lovers everywhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
