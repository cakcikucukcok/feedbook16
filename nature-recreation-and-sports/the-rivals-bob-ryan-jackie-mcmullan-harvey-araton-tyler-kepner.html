  <title>The Rivals - Bob Ryan, Jackie McMullan, Harvey Araton, Tyler Kepner...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Struggle for the Ages. . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOSTON GLOBE           JANUARY 6, 1920&lt;br&gt;RED SOX SELL RUTH FOR $100,000 CASH&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Demon Slugger of American League, Who Made 29 Home Runs Last Season, Goes to New York Yankees&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;FRAZEE TO BUY NEW PLAYERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yankees vs. the Red Sox.  Each baseball season begins and ends with unique intensity, focused on a single question: What&#39;s ahead for these two teams? One, the most glamorous, storied, and successful franchise in all of sports; the other, perennially star-crossed but equally rich in baseball history and legend.  In &lt;i&gt;The Rivals&lt;/i&gt; sports writers of &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt; come together in the first-ever collaboration between the two cities&#39; leading newspapers to tell the inside story of the teams&#39; intertwined histories, each from the home team&#39;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning with the Red Sox&#39;s early glory days (when the Yankees were perennial losers), continuing through the Babe Ruth era and the notorious trade that made the Yankees champions (and marked the Sox with the so-called &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot;); to Ted Williams vs. Joe DiMaggio; Thurman Munson and Carlton Fisk; Roger Clemens and Pedro Martinez; down to last year&#39;s legendary playoff showdown, &lt;i&gt;The Rivals&lt;/i&gt; captures the drama of key eras, events, and personalities of both teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And who better to tell the story than the baseball writers of the two rival cities? For &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, it&#39;s Dave Anderson, Harvey Araton, Jack Curry, Tyler Kepner, Robert Lipsyte and George Vecsey who report on the Yankee view of the rivalry, while &lt;i&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;loch&#39;s Gordon Edes, Jackie MacMullan, Bob Ryan and Dan Shaughnessy recount the view from the Hub. And their stories are richly illustrated with classic photographs and original articles from the archives, capturing the great moments as they happened. For Red Sox fans, Yankees fans, or anyone interested in remarkable baseball history, &lt;i&gt;The Rivals&lt;/i&gt; is an expert, up-close look at the longest, and fiercest of all sports rivalries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
