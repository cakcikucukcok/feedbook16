In fact, Hearts is a trick-taking game but it&amp;rsquo;s nothing like other trick-taking games. That&amp;rsquo;s because it is actually a game of evasion! Thinking that you need to take as many tricks as possible to win is the first mistake of most people attempting to play Hearts.&lt;br /&gt;

If you are already somewhat familiar with the game, don&amp;rsquo;t worry&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of room for improvement, something that you are soon about to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
This Hearts guide will arm you with tricks and strategies as well as information about similar Hearts variations that will skyrocket your potential in the game.&lt;br /&gt;
