  <title>Rhyme and Reason - Subathra Raman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is so much power in the written word, but that power is often forgotten or overlooked by young people, so pressured by school, family, and the future. Rhyme and Reason is a collection that creates characters a younger audience can identify with. In so doing, poet Subathra Raman seeks to instill a love of words and nature at an early age.
Some would say poetry is just for grown-ups. Well, that isnt true. A child can learn just as much from the written word as his or her father or mother. Poems in this collection focus on the varied themes of nature and its wonders, the animal kingdom, and vibrant personalities in a world of fantasy and imagination.
Color photographs match the theme of each poem, and themes are far-reaching. For instance, Subathra explains why words are so powerfuland how to use them to heal instead of hurt. She discusses how our thoughts control us, so why not have good thoughts? She also reminds young people to observe the wonders of nature and pay attention to life, one day at a time." />
