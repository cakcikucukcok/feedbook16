  <title>Far Beyond the Castle: Stories of travel and growth - Paolo Ballardini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A journey, after all, neither begins in the instant we set out, nor ends when we have reached our doorstep once again. It starts much earlier and is really never over, because the film of memory continues running on inside of us long after we have come to a physical standstill.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ryszard Kapu?ci?ski: &lt;em&gt;Travels with Herodotus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For years I have gone looking for Eden, parts of the planet where the world has changed little since the dawn of human life. Over time those areas have shrunk: uncontaminated nature became sequestered into clusters of land, increasingly encircled by &amp;ldquo;civilisation&amp;rdquo;. Without even noticing it, I switched my attention to those parts of the world where local conditions are so harsh that the land is left alone or in the back alleys of civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wanderlust is perhaps a desirable illness in the post-industrial era. In our consciousness, a background noise remains, telling us that the humanly manipulated world is fragile, ephemeral, and ultimately false. That is why finding the strength to leave the things we find comfortable and go far beyond our castle is so important.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The journey may shed light on our nature and help us to reposition ourselves in the cosmos, the natural world and among our peers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Far Beyond the Castle is a different travel book. It is a collection of stories on five continents that explores adventure travel from different angles: the insights about human nature we might discover in remote lands, among remote peoples; the beauty of unmodified nature; our rationale for being a species apart; the emotions that are prompted by what we experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
