  <title>Orangutan Rescue - Sean Whyte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tying in with International Orangutan Day on August 19, a British charity is releasing a new book, Orangutan Rescue which tells the emotive story of their efforts to save theorangutanfrom extinction. International Animal Rescue has spent the past six years creating a sanctuary in a remote part of Borneo that is home to nearly 100 young orangutans who have been injured ororphaned by the relentless march of the palm oilmanufacturers who have been decimating theirforest habitats. The coffee-table book, beautifully illustrated with hundreds of stunning full-colour photographs, shows how the dedicated veterinary staff and volunteers have worked tirelessly to protect the future of a remarkably intelligent primate which shares 96.4% of our genes. Written by animal welfare pioneers Sean Whyte and Alan Knight, Orangutan Rescue gives readers a unique insight into the highs and lows of rescuing and rehabilitating this species with the eventual aim of returning them to their protected forest homes. Whilst the book describes how the clinic near the small town of Ketapang in West Kalimantan, cameinto existence, it is the orangutans who are the stars of the story with many becoming worldwide internet sensations as their rescue and progress back to health is followed on the social media.Tying in with International Orangutan Day on August 19, a British charity is releasing a new book, Orangutan Rescue which tells the emotive story of their efforts to save theorangutanfrom extinction.
