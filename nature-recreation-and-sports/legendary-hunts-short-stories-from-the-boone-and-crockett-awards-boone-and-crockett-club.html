Legendary Hunts offers a unique glimpse at the apex of our hunting culture everyday hunters who defied the odds to take an exceptional trophy. You will feel the emotion, pride, care, dedication, and excitement as you enjoy the stories of the men and women who have taken these outstanding trophies. One hunter pursued an individual buck over several seasons until he finally tagged what would become a new World&amp;rsquo;s Record. You will read the story of a dedicated bowhunter and of the meticulous preparation and tactics that resulted in his taking of an outstanding bull elk. You will share with the authors their experiences in rain, snow, sleet, and harsh conditions. Finally, and most importantly, you will see that each of these hunters embraced the concept of fair chase, and for that they should be applauded because the truth is, any animal taken fairly is a trophy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
