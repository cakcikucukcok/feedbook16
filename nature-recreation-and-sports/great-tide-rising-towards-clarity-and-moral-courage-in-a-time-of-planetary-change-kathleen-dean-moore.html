      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Even as seas rise against the shores, another great tide is beginning to rise &amp;#150; a tide of outrage against the pillage of the planet, a tide of commitment to justice and human rights, a swelling affirmation of moral responsibility to the future and to Earth&amp;#8217;s fullness of life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Philosopher and nature essayist Kathleen Dean Moore takes on the essential questions: Why is it wrong to wreck the world? What is our obligation to the future? What is the transformative power of moral resolve? How can clear thinking stand against the lies and illogic that batter the chances for positive change? What are useful answers to the recurring questions of a storm-threatened time &amp;#150; What can anyone do? Is there any hope?
