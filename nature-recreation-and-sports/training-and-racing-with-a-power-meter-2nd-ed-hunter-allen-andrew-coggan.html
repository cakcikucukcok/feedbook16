  <title>Training and Racing with a Power Meter, 2nd Ed. - Hunter Allen, Andrew Coggan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hunter Allen and Andy Coggan, PhD have completely revised the book that made power meters understandable for amateur and professional cyclists and triathletes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power meters have become essential tools for competitive cyclists and triathletes. No training tool can unlock as much speed and endurance as a power meter--for those who understand how to interpret their data. A power meter displays and records exactly how much energy a cyclist expends, which lends unprecedented insight into that rider&#39;s abilities and fitness. With the proper baseline data, a cyclist can use a power meter to determine race strategy, pacing, and tactics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Training and Racing with a Power Meter&lt;/i&gt; makes it possible to exploit the incredible usefulness of the power meter by explaining how to profile strengths and weaknesses, measure fitness and fatigue, optimize workouts, time race readiness, and race using power. This new edition: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enables athletes to predict future performance and time peak form&lt;li&gt;Introduces fatigue profiling, a new testing method to pinpoint weaknesses&lt;li&gt;Includes two training plans to raise functional threshold power and time peaks for race day&lt;li&gt;Offers 75 power-based workouts tuned for specific training goals&lt;li&gt;This updated edition also includes new case studies, a full chapter on triathlon training and racing, and improved 2-color charts and tables throughout.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Training and Racing with a Power Meter&lt;/i&gt;, will continue to be the definitive guide to the most important training tool ever developed for endurance sports.&lt;/p&gt;" />
