Harvey Frommer, the celebrated baseball historian and author of eight books about the Yankees, including &lt;i&gt;The New York Yankee Encyclopedia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Remembering Yankee Stadium&lt;/i&gt;, has outdone himself this time around. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ultimate Yankee Book &lt;/i&gt;combines oral history with stories of legendary figures and epic Yankee feats. Featuring an exhaustive timeline, a challenging 150-question Yankee quiz, entertaining sections on Yankees by the numbers and nicknames and profiles of dozens of Yankee legends and luminaries, this is a book to treasure and turn to again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankee fans have bragging rights to call their team the greatest of all time.
