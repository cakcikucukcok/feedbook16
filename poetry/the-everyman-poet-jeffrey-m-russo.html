&lt;i&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;With Every Second That I Can&lt;/b&gt;
I hold her face within my hands
In the darkness of night and tell
Her that I love her like no other.
I look into her eyes to see a 
Youth riddled by my heart and
Watch a love tinted in sorrow
And a strength Ive never seen before.
The silence that falls on my words,
I understand all too clearly with
My mind, but my heart just doesnt
Want to let go.
For she is beauty and perfection
To me, and one day Ill have
To watch her leave, until then
Though Ill love her with every
Second that I can.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;" />
