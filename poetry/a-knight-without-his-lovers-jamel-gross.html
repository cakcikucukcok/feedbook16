  <title>A Knight Without His Lovers - Jamel Gross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Book Summary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Knight Without His Lovers is a set poetries where readers will feel falling in love all over again. I feel compelled to talk about the dark ages in that time to love and not to love and to love again. This is a classic tale of love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the Author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a relaxing day, Jamel enjoys a good book to start the day. He hopes everyone enjoys an opportunity to purse their dreams in life. He likes to take time and enjoy life. He believes that sometimes things aren&amp;#39;t as promised, that people should never take loved ones for granted, spend time with family and friends. The drive is the most intoxicating force. The author feels as if he is on a mission. He hopes for world peace and for the lives that were lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a writer, Jamel finds people fascinating. For him, it is only the beginning until the clock is up. &amp;ldquo;Precious time, precious few. Make time and savour the moment for no obstacles come between you and the gift... A little robust, a good jolt to start the day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
