  <title>Songs of Childhood (Illustrated) - Walter De La Mare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is an edited and illustrated version of the original one and includes 18 or more unique illustrations which are relevant to its content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The poetry of Walter de la Mare sings boldly and beautifully without any of these hedges and condescensions. His work has the honest candor of the border ballads and the fairy tales: as well as unmitigated joys, they are full of the dangers and horrors and sorrows that every child soon knows to be part of the world, however vainly parents try to veil them. A child&amp;#39;s curiosity about the forbidden will insist on being satisfied; and better by verse than otherwise. This poetry is also musically astute and demanding; it may surprise and alert the parental reader; and it has its share of archaisms and poeticisms, which, contrary to adult surmise, bemuse and fascinate children. And it must be admitted that it is also relentlessly British; but then, so is much good children&amp;#39;s literature." />
