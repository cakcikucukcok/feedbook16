  <title>The Orange Crystal-Like Doorknob - Mike Hanmer Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="about this book
now how do i begin to describe this book, it a poetry book but it doesnt have the one category for all poems, there are poems  about experience, life , memories, feeling  , and of course just a lot of fun,
there are the ones i wrote for friends to celebrate or commerate events in their lives too , and in particular theres the one MUM FOR YOU was written when my mother went into a care home in october , and her health was failing her,
and when she did pass away on 28 nov 2013 i penned STILL MISSING YOU i hope a few people can relate to the sentiments of the words.
but as i  mentioned there are fun poems to with fictional characters and situations, but even some of those may give rise to debate,
finally one of the fun ones is actually based on true events , the title DAVE THE RAVE, i hope you enjoy" />
