  <title>Nigh-No-Place - Jen Hadfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Winner of the T.S. Eliot Prize.The language of Jen Hadfield&#39;s poetry is one of incantation and secular praise. Her first book, Almanacs, was a traveller&#39;s litany, featuring a road movie in poems set in the north of Scotland. Nigh-No-Place is the liturgy of a poet passionately aware of the natural world.Hadfield began her new book on the hoof, travelling across Canada, hungry for new landscapes. She took epic routes: the railway from Halifax to Vancouver and the Dempster Highway&#39;s 740 km of gravel road, ending in the Arctic oiltowns of Inuvik and Tuktoyuktuk. But it is in Shetland that she becomes acutely aware of her own voice.Nigh-No-Place reflects the breadth of ground she&#39;s covered. &#39;Ten-minute Break Haiku&#39; is her response to working in a fish factory. &#39;Paternoster&#39; is the Lord&#39;s Prayer uttered by a draught-horse. &#39;Prenatal Polar Bear&#39; takes place in Churchill, Manitoba, surrounded by tundra.&#39;Nigh-No-Place is a revelation: jaunty, energetic, iconoclastic -even devil-may-care...she is a remarkably original poet near the beginning of what is obviously going to be a distinguished career&#39; -Andrew Motion.&#39;A zestful poet of the road... Jen Hadfield conjures poems of great spirit and imaginative daring from the northern landscapes. Lively, youthful and full of the joy of language&#39; -Kathleen Jamie.&#39;Onomatopoeia, alliteration, rhyme and a smattering of Shetland dialect supply Hadfield&#39;s world with a rackety music -claws on tarmac, a rock-chip hitting a windscreen, a waterproof crackling &#39;like a roasting rack of lamb&#39;-which she orchestrates with a variety of forms including prose poems, incantations, spells and a prayer.... When much contemporary poetry has about it a whiff of the coterie, Hadfield&#39;s refreshing voice carries all the way from the top of Scotland to blow some of the dust off British verse&#39; -Stephen Knight, Independent.Winner of the T.S.
