  <title>The Poems of Edgar Allan Poe - Edgar Allan Poe, W. Heath Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The importance of Edgar Allan Poe to literary history can hardly be exaggerated; his genius and originality, both in terms of language and technique, influenced the French Symbolists of the late 19th century and thus changed the course of modern literature. Although chiefly remembered for his short stories, poetry was his first love, and this magnificently decorated edition presents Poe&#39;s complete poems in addition to his most important critical essays on poetry. &lt;BR&gt;Featuring such immortal works as &quot;The Raven&quot; &quot;Annabel Lee,&quot; and &quot;The Bells,&quot; this volume meticulously re-creates the famed 1900 Endymion edition, a series comprising the works of Robert Browning, Keats, and other luminaries. Poe&#39;s dark obsessions and fascination with the supernatural find a perfect match in the powerful and haunting imagery of artist W. Heath Robinson, whose headpieces, tailpieces, decorated titles, and other illustrations appear throughout the book.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
