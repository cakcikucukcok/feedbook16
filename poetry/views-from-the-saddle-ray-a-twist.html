  <title>Views from the Saddle - Ray A. Twist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;A letter from Ann Twist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray has been writing poetry for many years, but started writing more in l998, after I retired and had time to type them up for him.  It has been a hobby that we both have enjoyed and loved to share with our family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I refer to Ray as my poem machine.  He seldom misses a day writing at least one and many times as many as three.  Its been such a joy to share them.      For many years, before he retired , he would write just occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
   	&lt;p&gt;When our grandchildren were small, and would come to spend some time with us, he would always leave a poem for them on the table when he left for work. They always enjoyed his little stories that rhymed.  Our dream is to publish a childrens book.&lt;/p&gt; 
      	&lt;p&gt;We have enjoyed compiling and sharing them.  My favorite are his spiritual, but, he has some wonderful western ones. Notice that he has some written, including some cow-boys that he has named Randy, Rusty, Lefty and Slim. We do hope that you will enjoy the ones we have put together for you.&lt;/p&gt;
God Bless You and Your families.&lt;/br&gt;
