  <title>Outlands - Weston Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Outlands by Weston Smith Edited by Anney Terrain and Ingrid Jacobsen. Portions of Outlands were previously published by Unwin Dunraven. Special thanks to Candice Mays, Garett Strickland, Freddie Nunez, and Dallas Smith.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Smith Brothers Publishing&lt;br /&gt; First edition 2016&lt;br /&gt; ISBN: 978-1-942359-17-3&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OUTLANDS.PUB&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I set this book in Moreno Valley, California, the small desert city where I spent my adolescence. It&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s known as an exurb - not quite suburban, but not quite rural. Located 60 miles east of Los Angeles, it&amp;#39;s being transformed into a warehousing and shipping logistics hub. It&amp;#39;s a post-modern truck stop, just outside of everywhere, and there are many other cities just like it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Outlands, these poems, exist similarly on some electric fringe, in a valley, an hour&amp;#39;s drive from anywhere you know.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Outlands is a place in between places. It is our home.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The only tourism in the Outlands is in gas stations and diner chains off the freeway as people refuel, on their way to more idyllic locations where more than tumbleweeds grow. However, I have heard rumor of tumbleweed tourism from folks that grew up in Connecticut and wish to see all the wild west has to offer. Our tumbleweeds generate no revenue, they just get stuck under and in things.&lt;/p&gt;" />
