  <title>I Do . . . but to Who?! - Lingeela Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mr. Lingeela L. Johnson is a native of Savannah, Georgia. He always has had the talent of writing; however, he never considered putting it into book form until others encouraged him to do so. After experiencing grave relationship difficulties, which resulted from the pain of a past college relationship, the author started writing and found it to be cathartic. Love paid the bond to bail the author out of heartbreaks prison. As a result, he willingly can serve a life sentence of purpose. Once Lingeela learned the power of forgiveness, purpose was birthed out of pain, the victim became victorious, and the chump became chosen!
I Do . . . but to Who?! is about the journey of love being tucked safely in the layaway, only to be redeemed by its rightful owner! What is her name? Is the girl of the authors dreams loud and stubborn, refusing wise counsel? Is she a habitual gossiper moving from house to house employed as a licensed professional busybody (LPB)? Does she appear humble as a lamb or hungry as a ravenous wolf?
I Do . . . but to Who?! is about love searching out to the author; however, the author is waiting with the patience of Job for his change to come in the form of his bride. He is surrounded with many love interests who are in close proximity, but they are not in tune to the frequency of his calling to fulfill.
I Do . . . but to Who?! also has an added bonus with in-depth commentary describing each psalm, including their original dates written. Each psalm will move you away from the intersection of disappointment to the prosperous corner of expectation. Are you ready to leave the dead end of Heartbreak Boulevard in your rearview mirror and cruise to a street called Desire? As the reader travels on the yellow brick together with the author and his companion, theyll soon discover finding the road to love, then pave it. The final destination is for both the author and the reader to permanently reside on Love Street. Can you tell me how to get to Love Street?
I Do . . . but to Who?! is not only my story (and Im sticking to it) but a natural fact and my truth. In closing, let us forget not to remember and remember not to forget to say, I do! Till death do us part!" />
