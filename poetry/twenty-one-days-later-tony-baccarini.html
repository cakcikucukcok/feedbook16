  <title>Twenty One Days Later - Tony Baccarini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whats this book about, and why did you put pen to paper? Simple. After being in a state of mind that threatened my existence, which would have had repercussions for others, if my issues were not dealt with.
In order to try and get the answers, I needed to have the questions to ask myself. It was a big deal to up and leave everything and everyone at a minutes notice and fly to a place where I had never been toa place I have never seen. I would have no choice but to jump in with both feet and sink or swim.
Being honest with myself was most important to my process. If I did not, it would be for nothing. I could not risk it, and the frame of mind I was in would have been disastrous as everything I worked for would have come crashing down around me. 
 When I got there, my journey really began. I found out that once you go back to basics and dump the materialistic baggage behind, you become humble and a pleasant human being again. You slow right down, accepting everything that is given out, and along this path, I found out what was really important and who that somebody was, and after all the pain and soul-searching, I found that person as it was there all along. I was me. I had to then come to terms with being diagnosed an illness on how to deal with a failing marriage and coming to terms with the tragic loss of my son all in three weeks, and then the words and where they came frommaybe a gift from aboveto help me find true inner peace and drop all negativity that had built up over the years to an awakening of normality, that if someone with a problem of mind received an emotional connection with the poems or their content, and it helped them in some small way, then I know it would be a great thing as I witnessed this effect while in the clinic, which urged me to write this book as a positive gesture to what I went through in twenty-one days." />
