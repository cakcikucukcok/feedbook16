  <title>40+ Love Ii - Mi Sook Park Westman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two years have passed after the separation from eighteen years relationship. Four seasons, one year have passed after the divorce. There have been pain and pleasure, sorrow and happiness, and frustrations and inspirations in every corner of four seasons for the lost heart and soul. As you read through each line of the poems, you can literally explore the landscape and the season that the author has experienced.
This book starts with winter and finishes with autumn. Winter is the season of healing sores under silence and tranquil. Spring is the season of hoping for a new love under excitement and whispers. Summer is the season of hot passion under desire and lust. Fall is the season of a peaceful balance under recollection and reflection.
The author refuses to give up a hope of everlasting love, trust on humankind, and belief in goodness and greatness in the universe. Continuous visits to fear and pain, but also to passion and hope, reveal a fragile and imperfect humanity within her." />
