  <title>Honoring - Pat Morrell-Donnelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book of poems by Pat Morrell-Donnelly about Honoring God, 
Honoring Family, Honoring Friends, and Honoring Country.    It is a very personal book but she hopes readers will relate to the thoughts in her poems.
It is an attempt to pay homage to those that have touched her life in 
their own special, unique way.
The dictionary states, Honor is about respect, recognition, and esteem shown to others.   Reverence implies, Profound respect mangled with love, devotion, or awe.
Pat states, For those of us that had loving parents, loving families, 
and lifetime friends we have been greatly blessed.  And to have been 
born into an exceptional country like the U.S.A., even as a child of 
the depression, knowing struggles and adversities, we still have been 
doubly blessed.  She says, Trials and challenges only made us 
stronger.  We believed if we wanted anything monetarily we had to work 
for it.  We never thought of relying on the government.
Pat says, Unlike some of our citizens today being brainwashed, we 
were ALWAYS proud of our country.  We believed in being responsible, 
working hard to attain a better life, and always treating others as we 
would like to be treated.
Honoring is a book of poems about faith, hope, and love and 
inspirational and motivational thoughts.  Also poems about her precious family, her loved ones and friends, and poems in memory of those that have gone on before us.   Also poems of appreciation for our great country and those that have sacrificed and paid the ultimate price for our freedom.
Thoughts in these poems come from difficulties and challenges and 
losses experienced while traveling her lifes journey, and hopefully 
they will touch the readers in a way to better equip them to face 
their own challenges and adversities.
Strength derived from family and friends and Pats strong faith has
brought her through many difficult times and while she cant speak to 
all she is hoping through these poems she can show her appreciation 
for the part many have played in her life.  For these she will be 
forever grateful." />
