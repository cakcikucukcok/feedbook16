  <title>Bernadette’S Book - Hugh Oram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bernadettes Book is the story of a dynamic Irishwoman with a great story to tell. Bernadette comes from a fascinating family background, in Dublin and in Thurles, Co Tipperary. The book tells of her early days growing up in a Dublin that was radically different from the present day city. It narrates her career, which was spent entirely in the Irish foreign service, at the headquarters of what is now the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and tells of the many world dignitaries she met, from John F. Kennedy to Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco. The book also details her marriage to Hugh Oram-theyve now been married for 45 years-and all the travel and other adventures theyve had together. Bernadette is a truly remarkable woman and this is her story." />
