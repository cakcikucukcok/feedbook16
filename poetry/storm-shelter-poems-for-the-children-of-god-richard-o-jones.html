  <title>Storm Shelter Poems for the Children of God - Richard O. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was especially written for spiritual people on a spiritual journey that are receptive to a little poetic philosophy along the way. People that are drowning in a sea of false accusations, riding high in the saddle but can&#39;t stand the horse, have big money but low self esteem, living in sin and enjoying every moment, or living right but feeling bad can personally relate to many of the poems in this book. People that are in the throes of affliction but refuse to surrender, this book will become your amen corner while provoking reflection and deep thought. When the big party is over and all your fair-weather guests are gone - this book helps clean up the aftermath.
The scrapes, scratches, and healed wounds of life inspired the author to poetically encourage and guide readers through the emotional swampland of tomorrow and fear no evil. These poems do not imply that the road is not rocky and the sky is not cloudy nor will the sun brighten your every day. This book is not intended to eradicate your storms but only to become your umbrella... with only a couple microscopic leaks." />
