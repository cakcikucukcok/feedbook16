  <title>My Inner Child Must Be Heard - Corina Zalace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Inner Child Must Be Heard&lt;/strong&gt; is the story in poetry of Corina&#39;s life and the many challenges she has faced. Her poems show how God brought her through every situation, and brought healing into her life. Corina&#39;s hope is that those who read her poems will find the same kind of healing that she has found through her Lord Jesus Christ, the Healer, Joy and Strength filling her every day. Life has not been easy, living with a body disabled by polio. Yet Corina maintained a positive attitude through every situation. She has learned that she has the choice of becoming bitter or becoming better. She has chosen to become better and thoroughly enjoy life because of her love of people and the desire to see them healed as she has been healed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
