  <title>Travels with the Wild Man Volume Iii - Timothy M. Nugent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My wife was a prodigious card giver. I put her many cards to poems for a lasting memory of her.
Soon, Timothy M Nugent: A Collection of Poems, with personal thoughts on life. Everything from my dogs behavior to personal tragedy. Political mayhem to personal life. Travelogue 2 came from the many miles we traveled on the Harley. Just out: The Lonely Biker, a story of a young man struggling to regain his life after a tragedy, death, revenge, and justice put in verse. Also Understanding, a book of personal thoughts. 
Hopefully by the beginning of December, a new travelogue, Travels with the Wildman 3. I hope you enjoy all my books. I am looking forward to publishing a new book this year: Poems of Costa Rica. Until then, pura vida!
