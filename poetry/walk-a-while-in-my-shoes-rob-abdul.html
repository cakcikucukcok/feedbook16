  <title>Walk a While in My Shoes - Rob Abdul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Walk a While in My Shoes is a collection of poems that are an account of one man&#39;s journey in life, from teenager right into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a record of the key events and moments through hurt, frustration and at times, sheer inspiration, that compelled me to write my poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the central themes of this collection of works are love, loss and an admiration of femininity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey starts when I am at the tender age of fifteen years old. The background setting is the back streets ofBirmingham, Middle England in the mid 1990s. Originating from a large family of two sisters and six brothers, I was a middle child. In my teens, not being heard or noticed was the reason poetry became an escape to vent my bottled up emotions that ran riot, in verse form on a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents were going through a separation whilst I was is in the final year of high school. It was then that a poem I had written in my creative writing class was entered for a competition. This marked the beginning of my writing adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adventure has had its highs and lows. The lowest of which was the loss of my brother Kalam in a tragic road accident. The never ending high point started when I was twenty two years old. That is when I met the love of my life. As it was true for Romeo and Juliet, who each came from opposing households, the same was true for Nicky and her Rob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicky comes from a Sikh family and I from a Muslim family. These are two religious backgrounds that conventionally do not mix. This struggle gave access to a whole new reservoir of inspiration to tap into.&lt;/p&gt;" />
