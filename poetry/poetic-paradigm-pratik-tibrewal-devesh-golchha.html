  <title>Poetic Paradigm - Pratik Tibrewal, Devesh Golchha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Romance, Society and Philosophy are three facets of Life, and this book summarises their aspects. Through poems, the poets have tried to juxtapose the outer world with the deepest inner emotions; to explore the outer world and take a plunge within. This humble collection of original poems bears the sweet fragrance of truth and the bitter harshness of reality. It showcases Lifes Paradigm and the carefully crafted poetic words sing a symphony for the soul. The poets, by way of this book, try to bring you closer to the thoughts one no longer thinks, show you the path one no longer takes, and aim to arouse the desire to seek a kind of solace one rarely seeks. This book will leave you in despair, yet give you hope; it portrays an array of emotions through the poems, which are written with immense inspiration. 
It talks about the intricacies of love, the flaws of the society and the depths of philosophy; it talks about Life and lets you experience a wider perspective of its various phases. The poems are genuine works of creativity and the poets have written each poem deep from their hearts, making it a certainty that this book will strike various chords in the heart of you, the Reader. This book is an honest representation of the love for poetry and any reader who shares that love with the poets will find this book to be invigorating. 
The co-poets have been best friends for almost two decades and share a strong passion for writing. They write from their hearts and the readers will be able to relate to their poems on various levels." />
