  <title>I’Ll Be Right Here - Sandra H.Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gods ever-present love is with us no matter what.  Through feast or famine, difficulty or ease, He is there--and Sandra Moore has felt His presence throughout her life. The title of her poetry collection, &lt;em&gt;Ill Be Right Here&lt;/em&gt;, reflects not only words her own father used to say but also the words of her Father in Heaven who has never left her side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Moores poems reflect the sometimes painful, sometimes wonderous times of life.  No matter the amount of faith, no one is immune to difficulty.  In this collection of poems and essays, she shares with readers how some difficulties can be viewed as opportunities for strengthening and building endurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its been said we cannot enjoy light without knowing darkness; so it is with hard times.  Seen through the right lens, hard times can sometimes be empowering and eventually lead to times of comfort and peace that would not otherwise have been enjoyed to their full extent.  Dr. Moores poems reach to the innermost core of the human spirit, invigorated by Gods holy presence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
