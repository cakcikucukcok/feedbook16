  <title>Murm&#39;rings of the Heart - Olivia Villa-Real</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this fast-paced world of science and technology, we have set ourselves to a never-ending race with time. Weve lost our capacity to enjoy the simple pleasures in life. We have dulled our senses from appreciating the wild flowers along our way that flaunt their beauty and waft their fragrance on the breeze. We cast our vision hurriedly past the inviting pathways into the deep woods that eagerly entice us to take a moments rest. Lest we become robots devoid of feeling, machineries unable to experience bliss, we must elevate ourselves from the mundane to such loftiness of spirit as will enable us to experience and enjoy the true essence of life. This book offers us a sanctuary to rest our weary body and spirit, and its poetry allows us to feel the realities within ourselvestoo often missed, yet are far richer than the physical realities around us that are too commonplace and barren to appreciate. The poems tug at the root of our being, awakening the treasures lurking within uslittle gems too inspiring to miss and too beautiful to forget. 
This book is a window into my soulthe anima within me that gives me life. It is the true reality of my existencemore than the reality of my physical being. It is beyond what my intellect can reach and what my emotions can inspire. My poetry, which includes my songs, is the fresh breath of my soul; it is the raw expression of what is at my core, borne in the spur of the moment and perfected by inspiration. It is, therefore, in a spirit of love and absolute trust that I welcome you into this sanctuary of my soul since I render myself bare, naked, and vulnerable as I put you in touch with my true reality, which is devoid of fear, pretenses, inhibitions, as well as self-serving needs or purpose." />
