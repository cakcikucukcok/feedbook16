  <title>Can You Hear Me Now?: Finding My Voice in a System That Stole It - Angela McCrimmon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Angela McCrimmon - Nominated for Health Champion Hero Award 2016&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The thoughts and feelings I should have felt safe enough to entrust &amp;nbsp;in the hands of a Professional are now finding their way from the entrapment of my head to the healing I am finding in my writing. Revealing that although I&amp;#39;ve battled Self-Harm on the outside, the real harm was often done by Mental Health Professionals themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a roller-coaster ride writing this book but definitely one I had to ride to get to the other side. Determined to finally stand up for myself and to encourage others to stand alongside me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Often dismissed, ignored, and scared into silence...&lt;br /&gt; Can you hear me now?&lt;/p&gt;" />
