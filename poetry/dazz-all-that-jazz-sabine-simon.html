  <title>Dazz &amp; All That Jazz - Sabine Simon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My friendly warning to the fortunate readers of Dazz &amp; All That Jazz is to buckle up; you are about to read a fascinating and historical book of poetry by Sabine Simon, also known as Dazz. Dazz will show you how a young woman from the island of Haiti can turn into a charismatic poet and share with you her true love experiences in America where she started her writing journey in 1996. Like a lot of poets, writing becomes a therapy after losing a loved one and after a painful break up with someone you love. When you try very hard to escape the pain, what can you do? You write about it. In this poem Escaping Pain, the author talks about her wrist, her knife, her blood, and her life. It is very unfortunate when you aimed for the best and you end up facing the worst relationship of your life.
Would I Be Wrong is another title of one of the poems in this book that will give you hope when you are down. This poem will place you in a church praising God, regardless if you were willing to do so or not.
Would I be wrong to want to be on the mountaintop?
How wrong can I be when I walk with the one who possesses eternity?
I Am Sorry is another title that shows the inner conscience of the poetess, that she is human, she has a big heart, and she is willing to forgive. But the pains will never be forgotten because of the scars that keep on reminding you of the sorrowful moments in your life.
This kaleidoscopic summary of countless events that you are about to read from Dazzs poetry is breathtaking and is indeed textually significant vis--vis anyone who has been in good/bad relationship.
Dazzs poetry was written with an innate passion and unconditional love. This book was written in raw accuracy of what you, the reader, could have been or are dealing with in your relationships as we speak." />
