  <title>Unconditional Forbidden Love - Vicki Case</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I wont be the last woman who found true love and her soul mate in the arms of a Forbidden Fruit that belonged to another. I wont be the last woman to endure the heart and head struggle with right and wrong, for love and desire. I wont be the last woman to surrender her heart, her soul and her body to a man, only to have it taken by him and then discarded. Nor will I be the last woman who endures the hurt, the pain and the loss at losing the love of her life and her soul mate and in such an insensitive and cowardly manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wont be the last man who found himself loving two women at once. Nor will he be the last man to succumb to temptation and desire in the arms of another woman, having to eventually decide on one, knowing full well that the discarded one will be ultimately hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book of poetry is dedicated to the only man I have ever really loved; to the man who used to call me Gorgeous; to the man who told me I was amazing and too intelligent for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is for the man who picked me up from the depths of despair after a horrible and emotionally abusive marriage; who showed me that there is nothing that I cant do if I want to bad enough and; most importantly; to the man who showed me how to love him unconditionally and then; chose to severe me from his life with a text message, despite promising that he never would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these poems have been written from my heart for him and him alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book of poetry is for you, My Love, My Soul Mate, My Eros, and My Adonis, all rolled into one.&lt;/p&gt;" />
