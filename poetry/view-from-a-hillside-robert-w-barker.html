  <title>View from a Hillside - Robert W. Barker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The poems in View From A Hillside are selected from those written by the author over the last several years. Some are poems written for a fund-raising event for the Organization for New Americans, a community-based organization that provides education and assistance for new immigrants and refugees when they arrive in this great country. That need is as great now as it ever has been in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader will note that the author still has an affinity for the shorter forms of poetry, inspired by the Japanese haiku and tanka forms. However, sometimes a longer poem seems more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
Men of War&lt;/br&gt;

there is no war&lt;/br&gt;
unloved&lt;/br&gt;
