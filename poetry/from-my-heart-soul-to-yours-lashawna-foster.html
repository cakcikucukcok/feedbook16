  <title>From My Heart &amp; Soul to Yours - LaShawna Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I would like to dedicate this book to the Late-Hazel Bell Wheeler Page who
encouraged and started this writing process for me. It started over 30 years
ago when I went to visit my Grandmother on a regular basis and to find so
many children books in one particular room. I was fascinated and intrigued
of the nursery rhymes and the pictures in the book. I was always in a corner
with a book in my hand and the rest of the world was tuned out for hours. This
led to me entering school spelling bee contests, doing crossword puzzles with
my Uncle Harold and I started putting my thoughts on paper. Reading and
writing was another form of expression for me to describe what I was feeling
and going through in different phases of my life which led to this book. This
book of poems is a translation of my life or people around me. It depicts events
and situations that have happened throughout my lifetime. My Grandmother
encouraged me through the years and after she passed away, motivated me
to pursue my dreams.
&lt;p&gt;As a young adult I participated in Church Welcomes, Church Anniversaries
and Appreciations with my writing and I have compiled my poems together. I
literally pray about the occasion because I want the poem to inspire, motivate,
and encourage my listeners. Each poem plays a vital role in the person I am
today which led me to the title of my book, From My Heart and Soul to Yours.
Words are so powerful, that over the years I had to learn to be careful, of what
I release to the universe, because it could be damaging to the person on the
receiving end. People can sometimes receive your words incorrectly that is why
it is so easy for me to put my thoughts on paper.
&lt;p&gt;I have come to find out that the voids in my life; God has filled with positive
influences in my life. These positive influences have impacted in more ways than they can imagine. I personally would like to thank God for giving me this gift to
minister through writing. I want to thank my Mom who is the epitome of my
hard work, my sister Kenya, who exemplifies living out your dreams and my Uncle
Shawn who teased me in a good way for being a book worm during my childhood.
I want to thank my brothers-Odies, EJ and Reginald. I was touched by an Angel,
my daughter, LaShara, who started my first poem, Grown Before My Time
and making me the woman I am today. My personal family which consists of
the Wheelers, Page and Robinsons who have impacted my life genetically. I want
to thank my paternal grandmother, Delores, for keeping in touch with me and
the relationship you were determined to continue. My church family at Daytona
Deliverance Church of God in Daytona Beach, Florida, my Pastors Bishop QT
Wallace and Elga Wallace, my best friend and sister, Melissa, my cousin and
son, Brandon, my cousins, Mark and Shawanda, Ms. Mattie and Carmela, my
spiritual family and encourager, The Albright family, Cynthia, Janay and Fatima
were others who have impacted my life as positive influences.
&lt;p&gt;To every reader that connects with my book; I pray this book inspire,
motivate, encourage, and impact your life in a positive manner. I pray that it
transforms, reconfigure, transpire, change, and redirect you to examine the
path of your life. I am a firm believer that things happen for a reason, there
are no coincidences, that our lives are already pre-destined to happen and its
at this place and time, not only for my writing to be revealed, but for you to
receive what has been written. I have learned during this process that our lives
are an open book, and I had to reveal what has been closed for so long. I hope
that this book ministers to those who have gone through similar experiences,
and there will be more books to come in the future." />
