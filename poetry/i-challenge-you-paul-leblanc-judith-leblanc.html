  <title>I Challenge You - Paul LeBlanc, Judith LeBlanc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our book I Challenge You is credited to our Savior, Jesus Christ. We wrote this book at a time when neither one of us was tied down to anything. God just downloaded this book into our hearts. We believe our book serves as a purpose to expose the heartbeat of God to the believer but also to the nonbeliever, to have us fix our eyes on Jesus, who knows everything about us. We have brought in a little bit of poetry to convince the reader that this isnt just any ordinary book; it is a book that readily helps you discover the true heart of God our Father for us. It challenges us to rise higher and to not settle for anything less but to really follow Gods heart for our lives. When we wrote this book, we really believe that Gods heart is good and that this book will help you to believe in the miracles that God wants to pour out on your life and how he wants you to be challenged to believe again, if you have ever lost hope or believed in something other than our Fathers heart. Our writing has inspired many people, and we hope it also touches the hearts of our readers as they allow themselves to let go and just listen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
