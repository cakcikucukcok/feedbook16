5.0 out of 5 stars The Big Blush, July 24, 2012 By &lt;i&gt;bayvillegirl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
This review is from: &lt;i&gt;Wind In My Head: Volume 3 A Collection Of Our Poems Some W/Friends&lt;/i&gt; (Paperback).&lt;/br&gt;
I must admit this book made me blush! This book should have been titled 50 shades of Steve! Intimate, erotica. Well written.&lt;/p&gt;
5.0 out of 5 stars Red Hot!, August 9, 2012 By &lt;i&gt;Sunset7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
This review is from: &lt;i&gt;Wind In My Head: Volume 3 A Collection Of Our Poems Some W/Friends&lt;/i&gt; (Paperback).&lt;/br&gt;
It has been many years since Ive read poetry and I didnt know what Ive been missing! Wow, quite a red hot read! Stephens writing talent shines through even as he writes blush evoking raw emotions of romance, longing and love. Beautifully written. One of his poems states I am poetry and I believe he is!&lt;/p&gt;

This review is from: &lt;i&gt;Wind In My Head: Volume 3 A Collection Of Our Poems Some W/Friends&lt;/i&gt; (Paperback)&lt;/br&gt;
I so enjoyed Stephen Sciallis romantic book. It expressed his feelings of intimacy and love, put to words in various degrees. The poetry was easy to read and understand. Depending on your mood, you could find something to spike your feelings to higher
levels. Looking forward to more reads from this writer. Wishing he and his books much success. Hope his future writings are just as romantic as this one. Thank you for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

This review is from: &lt;i&gt;Wind In My Head: Volume 3 A Collection Of Our Poems Some W/Friends&lt;/i&gt; (Paperback)&lt;/br&gt;
The title of this review is too mild, but I dont think I can say what it did to me! Im going to have to buy a pregnancy test! Oh it is magic on paper! Thank you, Stephen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verses of Words of Want offer vivid imagery that provides a mental picture and fires the imagination. Author Stephen Scialli describes his life experiences in poetry with a reality in his words that touches the soul. Every word is a carefully chosen thread, weaving stories that become a tapestry of times, places, emotions, and the deep love that one can feel. Scialli seeks to stimulate the senses and provoke new ideas through sensual words both serious and humorous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His poetry speaks to the heart and soul, recalling images of beautiful passion, intense pleasure, and deep emotions. From the deeply patriotic September 11, 2011 to the intense passion of his many poems of love, Words of Want is a poetry collection that inspires and stirs the senses to open a new world of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;your soul is beautiful&lt;/br&gt;
crying for love&lt;/br&gt;
i feel your soul&lt;/br&gt;
reaching the heavens&lt;/br&gt;
Bringing smiles&lt;/br&gt;
for those that love you&lt;/br&gt;
like me&lt;/p&gt;" />
