  <title>The Undesirable Black Diamond - Sally R. McGoon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book depicts the struggles and the hardships that a young girl endures growing up with a single parent background in a hostile ethnic environment where she was expected to live up to certain high standards. Caught in a vicious circle of false humility, hypocrisy, jealousy and competitiveness she was constantly ostracized for a crime beyond her control which is being the daughter of a high profile indigenous woman in the early 1960s till the mid 1980s. In retrospect, her mother was indeed very reputed and a respected member of society, was a Producer and Presenter for the ethnic womans program for the national radio station, hence a household name. She has travelled extensively around the globe representing her country many times. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In comparison this childs life was a living hell, likened to living in a glass house where nothing is hidden and everything is under surveillance and the scrutiny of constant criticism, harsh comparisons with other children, suffering emotional and verbal abuse, mounting peer pressure and the overwhelming expectations to perform to an unreasonable standard. Most failing to realise, that the two although mother and daughter, are separate entities who in their own right are special, unique and belong to different generations.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This occurred at a time where the norm was a life of respect and reverence for the chiefs and elders of the community. People are prone to act in a way of communal thinking and individuality is not really encouraged as emphasis is generally on the family reputation with little or no regard for the individuals that form the family. Unfortunately this practice still prevails today with some families back home which later cripples individuals and more so society. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In spite of how she started, how it affected and marred her life, she fought to survive the best way she knew how. She made mistakes along the way but still she searched to find her answers. She never settled for seconds but will fight to get only the best of what she can get. Never one to live life lying or sitting down she opted to face her opponent standing and with eyes wide open. Truly unafraid and yet fragile enough to and for change.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The battle is mostly won if you plan and brace yourself for the impact, though scarred but in time when healed, the enemy will eventually cease to win." />
