  <title>Shattered Dreams - Susan Peterson Lane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Shattered Dreams: A Girl Named Silas and Me, author Susan Peterson Lane presents a collection of powerful poetry that seeks to help each of us to find ourselves in the face of pain, hurt, and shame and enable us to escape the prisons, labels, and mistakes of both the past and present.
Lanes poems explore subjects ranging from freedom and relationship challenges to chaos and homelessness. In her verses, she seeks to teach us to forgive and forget, to accept and understand. Only then can we become the people we were meant to be. She presents in her collection the key to discovering and unlocking a positive future through the choices we make in our lives. As surely as we are born, we will die, but what we do during the time in between does matter. 
Offering hope for healing, Shattered Dreams speaks of one womans thoughts and feelings about her life.
A Voice Silenced
The death of a voice.
The burial of a choice.
A mind apprehended
by confusion.
But
A gift still in tack
Remembered not dismembered by time.
Still defined by holiness, truthfulness and righteousness, Peace is sublime." />
