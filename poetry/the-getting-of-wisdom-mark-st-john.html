  <title>The Getting of Wisdom - Mark St John</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Getting of Wisdom is a journey rather than a destination. This collection of verses outlines one young mans thoughts and feelings on a variety of themes and subjects that we are confronted with throughout our everyday lives. The business of growing up is tricky. Getting to know this world and our place in it is a constant struggle as is the much more difficult task of getting to know ones true self.  
The worst of bets that a young man regrets
From the irrational to the absurd
Is the search for truth when in his youth
Within the written word
Life throws up a variety of obstacles that can hinder a persons own pursuit of happiness. Writing is magic. Writing is my respite. Through the glorious gift of words and a process of deep reflection comes this heart wrenching exploration of one mans struggle for inner contentment and the Getting of Wisdom." />
