  <title>8th Son - Jimmy Boom Semtex</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book everyone has been waiting for. The new project by Jimmy Boom Semtex. It features his new work and several joint poems with other authors/writers/poets. The work is diverse and global in nature.   From the life questions of Jimmy&#39;s Coded Karma to the surreal dream poem where girls are hills in Mounded, there is variety here. Poems about a crashed warplane include Sunny 8. Others cover nature, war, life, hookers and truck drivers.  Examples of joint work includes nature with Lea Boyd, a nautical theme with Shy Lhen Esposo, political work with Gray Nicholls and reminiscing over coffee in a poem with Saurabh Pant.  Varied photographs give an added layer to the poetry.  Part 2 will follow soon and be just as unique.  Star Man Five peso coins look like burnished golden sovereigns. This is the land of  sparkling silver. I came here long ago. Following your ghost. One step aside you. Coloured by what? Mysteries. Of those unborn. The harbour. That&#39;s where my  spaceship is." />
