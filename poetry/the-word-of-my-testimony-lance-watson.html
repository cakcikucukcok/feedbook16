  <title>The Word of My Testimony - Lance Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Word of My Testimony is a book of poetry chronicling my life from a fledgling Christian to a seasoned soul winner. It is about the challenges of Christianity; the struggle between flesh and spirit. Christianity is an impossible way of life. It can only be done successfully when one is totally focused on Jesus and walks in the power of the Holy Spirit. Ive known the highs of victories and the lows of defeat. I have known awesome experiences with God. I love adventure and a degree of danger. God got loads of that for the one so inclined. Once one serves God, one becomes addicted to serving God. There is nothing like it. Id be willing to pay God just to allow me to serve Him. But such is not necessary. I have seen God go after people who the world had totally given up on. There is nothing that is even remotely close to the satisfaction, excitement, intimacy, and sense of accomplishment one experiences when one partners with God.
If people, including Christians, really know God,they will see that He will absolutely blow you away with His wonders to behold. God is no old man with a long beard napping on His royal rocking chair. And thats the goal of this book. To inspire, instruct, and encourage Christians to seek greater intimacy with God. For sure, one can be saved without experiencing intimacy with God. But thats like having a trillion dollars but only spending one dollar. It is also my goal to inspire the unsaved to discover Jesus, the One who loves them more than anything that He created. The book is really about Jesus&#39; Lordship and guiding Hand in my life. Hes in every word, every rhyme, every praise, and every heartache. Its&#39; about when He chastens His disobedient child. What makes Christianity supernaturally exciting is Jesus. Its a waste of time to be a Christian and not be intimate with Jesus. its&#39; similar to being married and not experiencing intimacy and excitement with your spouse. It is a tragedy to be a Christian and not serve Jesus in some capacity. Its&#39; like having a trillion dollars and spending just one." />
