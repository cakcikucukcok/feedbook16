  <title>The Biscuit Joint: Poems - David Kirby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Praise for David Kirby &lt;br&gt;&quot;Kirby is exuberant, irrepressible, maniacal and remarkably entertaining.... Okay, let me just say it: he is a wonderful poet.&quot; -- Steve Kowit, San Diego Union-Tribune&lt;br&gt;&quot;Kirby&#39;s voice and matter (teaching, literature, traveling, rock &#39;n&#39; roll, everyday bozohood) are utterly personal and, despite all the laughter, ultimately moving.&quot; -- Ray Olson, Booklist&lt;br&gt;&quot;[Kirby] is a poet who peels away the layers of our skin to show us who we are: our weaknesses, our strengths, and our hilarious obsessions.&quot; -- Micah Zevin, New Pages&lt;br&gt;&quot;The world that Kirby takes into his imagination and the one that arises from it merge to become a creation like no other, something like the world we inhabit but funnier and more full of wonder and terror.&quot; -- Philip Levine, Ploughshares&lt;br&gt;&quot;These poems may be too cool for words.&quot; -- Carol Muske-Dukes, New York Times Book Review&lt;br&gt;Inspired by the carpenter&#39;s biscuit joint -- a seamless, undetectable fit between pieces of wood -- David Kirby&#39;s latest collection dramatizes the artistic mind as a hidden connection that links the mundane with the remarkable. Even in our most ordinary actions, Kirby shows, there lies a wealth of creative inspiration: &quot;the poem that is written every day if we&#39;re there / to read it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Well known for his garrulous and comic musings, Kirby follows a wandering yet calculated path. In &quot;What&#39;s the Plan, Artists?&quot; a girl&#39;s yawning in a picture gallery leads him to meditations on subjects as diverse as musical composition, the less-than-beautiful human figure, and &quot;the simple pleasures / of living.&quot; The Biscuit Joint traverses seemingly random thoughts so methodically that the journey from beginning to end always proves satisfying and surprising.&lt;/p&gt;" />
