  <title>Escaping the Darkness of My Heart - Kendra J. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Within the pages of this book, you will experience the depth of my personal feelings from different times in my life. Things may appear rough and raw, but these things are the feelings of someone who isnt afraid to express herself through her words. You could be that person that is afraid to speak on the issue, but I spoke on the issue for you. You might find yourself saying, That is me. I am the one you speak of. Within the reflection of the mirror, there was only a skeleton, and within that skeleton was a hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let these words flow, &lt;br /&gt;
like my fear flows, &lt;br /&gt;
freely and without hesitation. &lt;br /&gt;
Let these words &lt;br /&gt;
show you the raw and rough &lt;br /&gt;
as I stand before you feed up and confused. &lt;br /&gt;
Let these words &lt;br /&gt;
flow into your heart. &lt;br /&gt;
Let these words &lt;br /&gt;
pierce your soul and set you free. &lt;br /&gt;
Let these words &lt;br /&gt;
cast a cloud over the hurt and pain that is within. &lt;br /&gt;
Let these words.&lt;/p&gt;" />
