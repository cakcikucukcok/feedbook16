  <title>A Saudi Woman’S Voice - Maha Noor Elahi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A fusion of witty sarcasm and deep dark emotional truths brilliantly woven by Maha Noor Elahi, her poetry speaks on behalf of many silent voices, opening a window to the rebellious, tender, exotic and powerful being that is called a Saudi woman.

A Saudi Womans Voice is a collection of poems that span over a decade and across various settings, in which the writer memoirs the world through a womans eyes, her dreams, silent wishes a world full of manipulation and deceit and the struggles women face in a world controlled by men and made to feel plagued by feelings of inadequacy and helplessness.  Noor Elahi offers a rare view into a Muslim womans identity how she views herself within the world around her when she comments on war, death and destruction as well in her never-ending quest for justice and peace. She also reflects on the various facets of a woman and offers her thoughts on motherhood, social hypocrisy, being a teacher, and the struggles of a poet, all in a gentle soul-searching journey. Readers will experience a womans struggle to make sense of experiences that became the focus of this journey of self-discovery prompting them to look into their own lives. The book is a fascinating experience for those interested in gaining awareness from both self-examination and mining the past in an effort to understand the present.
