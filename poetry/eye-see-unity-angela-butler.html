  <title>Eye See Unity - Angela Butler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Eye See Unity&lt;/i&gt; encompasses an array of powerful poems and motifs. The photographs featured in this book are taken at the Botanical Gardens. The author incorporates these photos bringing fourth her vision of how delicate and beautiful women are in comparison with her poetic work of art. The inspirational illustrations bare Angelas dream of empowering women nationwide. Her ultimate goal is to bring about positivity and unity amongst women from all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Eye See Unity&lt;/i&gt; campaign has put a positive spin on a popularly used term that is expressed when referring to women. In society today the term B***H is not only commonly used, but is accepted in most avenues. Angela has created positive messages with her H to the B logo empowering women to view and celebrate their finer qualities in an optimistic way.&lt;/p&gt;
The campaign will encourage women of all races, ages, class and sizes to be mindful of how we express ourselves because words are very powerful and we as women never want to give the wrong impression. We are phenomenal, courageous, and beautiful.
These are essential words to live by self-respect, self-love, self-worth, and self-esteem. Own them. Embrace them. Exude them! This is the vision of the Eye C Unity Project Angela Butler founder." />
