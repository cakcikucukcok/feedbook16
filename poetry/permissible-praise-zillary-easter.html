  <title>Permissible Praise - Zillary Easter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No more, Mr. Cocaine; do you stress me out. No more is my life a rout. No more can you win. God has the key and you cant win. Permissible Praise was written under the function of the Holy Spirit. After much prayer and seeking the right name for this book, it was given to me. These deep, heart searching and touching poems, prose, writings, etc tells the story of mans struggle from infancy through manhood. Youll experience mans struggle from drugs, alcohol, sex abuse, aids, and the love of money to the position of happiness, marriage, family and home life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soul of a people is expressed in poetry and song, writing and speaking. Permissible Praise illustrates the heart of mans inner connection to the Creator. &lt;br /&gt;
To the old, and young, and all in between, the daily problems that confront everyone; can or will make each of these poems come alive; whatever the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permissible Praise addresses a controversial and exciting style of poetry, inspires the spiritual mind, and motivates the uninspired to search the book for hope and solutions. The excitement within these pages will keep you reading; for it is hard to put down. When downloaded on your cell, IPad, or notebook, be careful, reading and walking can be hazardous to your health.&lt;/p&gt;" />
