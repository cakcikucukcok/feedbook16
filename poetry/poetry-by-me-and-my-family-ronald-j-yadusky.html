  <title>Poetry by Me and My Family - Ronald J. Yadusky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="POETRY BY ME AND MY FAMILY 
About ART, SCIENCE, LOVE &amp; LIFE
These poems are fun to read, and you learn something new about art, science, love and life. They come out of the love I have for my wife, Margaret, our children, and our love for each other. They awaken something in your heart that is beyond knowledge, and they spiritually refresh, because the poems say tangibly what we all feel intangibly to give finite form to the infinite. The will to create and the will to love are one. And so, poems make love visible, which uplifts and heals, because in the presence of love everything is healed. The mind seeks truth, the heart seeks love, and the spirit seeks goodness and God. This creative spirit of love, therefore, shows us the face of God." />
