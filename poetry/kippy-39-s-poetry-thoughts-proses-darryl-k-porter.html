This review is from: Kippys Poetry, Thoughts, Proses (Paperback)
&quot;Kippys Poetry, Thoughts, Proses&quot; by Darryl K. Porter seemed at first glance exactly as advertised; a book of insights shape by poetry, yet there is so much more. 
So while I think everyone will appreciate the observations leaven with wit, and be entertained by the turn of phrase,you will find it is only on the second reading that you began to realize the musicality of Darryls work. He seems to live in a world of rhythm, shaped by faith. 
The poem &quot;The Symphony&quot; is an example of the beautiful melding of both. 
Yet there is also an underlying anger see &quot;What is the Bottomline.&quot; aimed at those agencies that would shut down the potential we all have to express the music God gave us. 
This is a book of that offers a spiritual perspective of the varying emotions we all experience." />
