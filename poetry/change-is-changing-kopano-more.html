  <title>Change Is Changing - Kopano More</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Conveyed with a very infectious patriotism and a passionate drive to persevere which gives chills of pride, this book inspires one (especially young Africans) to bring forth their best for the betterment of self and relevant others. The author has an uncanny and versatile way of bringing forth some controversial issues affecting an everyday South African (Youth) in a frank, yet warm and with impeccable bravery. This book achieves a lot at once, easy to read, provocative and inspirational at the same time.
The timing of this book is so appropriate and I am proud it is produced by one of our own. The book of this stature shows that as a country we are not producing mediocrity but leaders of the 21st century 
Yvonne Chaka Chaka 
(South African Icon &amp; Legendary Singer, Humanitarian and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador /MDG envoy for Africa and former World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council member).
If not us, then who? If not our vision, then whos? We are living in the 21st century, an era that requires everyone, young and old too, as Kopano says, write their story. Change is Changing contains the inspiring message we need right now! It sheds light on how we can take advantage of change, the only constant, to write our collective story. A story that will read well for us and future generations.
