  <title>Confessions - Bryan Leblanc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The inspiration for these writings came from the darkest time in my life. I was thirty-five years old. Seven years into a good career. Ten years into a relationship, engaged to the love of my life, my soul mate. Eight years into an illness, being diagnosed type 1 diabetic. In a matter of one month, my company closed its doors two weeks before Christmas. My fiance moved out the Saturday before Christmas. My medical insurance cancelled on midnight, New Years Eve. I hit rock bottom. I gave up. Couldnt eat and couldnt sleep. I started a new job on December 28, but by January 4, I was hospitalized for my diabetes. I lost forty-five pounds in two weeks. The depression, the stress, and the heartbreak all came crashing down upon me. I was in ICU for two nights, in the hospital for four nights total. While in that bed, I wrote a poem. Not sure why. No one told me to. Then I wrote another. Just passing time, reliving my time with her. When I returned to work the next week, I found myself writing more poems. Three weeks, one hundred poems! She was the inspiration for my writing. Love, hate, sadness, and joy, its all there. The writing kept my emotions and my health at bay. She was and will always be my inspiration." />
