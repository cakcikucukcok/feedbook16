  <title>Eating the Honey of Words - Robert Bly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Robert Bly has had many roles in his illustrious career. He is a chronicler and mentor of young poets, many of whom he presented in his series of edited books&lt;em&gt;The Fifties, The Sixties,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Seventies&lt;/em&gt;. He was a leader of the antiwar movement, founded the mens movement virtually by himself, and published the bestseller &lt;em&gt;Iron John&lt;/em&gt;. All through these activities, he has continued to deepen his own poetry, a vigorous voice in a period of more academic wordsmiths. Now, in &lt;em&gt;Eating the Honey of Words,&lt;/em&gt; he presents the best poems he has written in the last ten years, as well as some favorites from his earlier books such as &lt;em&gt;Silence in the Snowy Fields, The Man in the Black Coat Turns,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Loving a Woman in Two Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. Joining these timeless classics are marvelous new poems from the last two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is a chance to reread, in a fresh setting, many of Blys most famous early poems, and in some instances to see how the old poems have changed over the years. In this new selection, which includes a number of poems from past decades never published before, one can see more clearly than ever the powerful undercurrents that carry this poetry from one book on to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a brilliant collection that confirms Robert Bly&#39;s role as one of Americas preeminent poets writing today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
