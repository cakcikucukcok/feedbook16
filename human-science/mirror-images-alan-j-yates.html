  <title>Mirror Images - Alan J. Yates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Take an unusual and wry look at the mass media by joining an industry insider who recalls the high and low points of an almost forty-year career.
Alan J. Yates, a media professional and academic, dissects the media business as a consumer, theorist, and participant. He observes that we tend to be literate when it comes to information technology but often illiterate regarding media process and impact.
As Yates looks back over his career, he shares personal anecdotes and lessons learned on the front lines of the business. He also examines a multitude of issues, including: 
	various connotations of the truth;
	ways to improve the training of media professionals;
	strategies to break into the news business and further your career.
The physical nature and infrastructure of the media constantly changes, and as technology becomes faster, smaller, and handier, the media can begin to have insidious influences. Yates emphasizes the importance of knowing what to guard against in this fast-changing world.
Whether you are an observer of the media, a participant, or a student, in &lt;i&gt; Mirror Images &lt;/i&gt; youll find an honest assessment of the medias history, future, and impact on the world." />
