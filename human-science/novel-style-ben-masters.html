  <title>Novel Style - Ben Masters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We live in a time of linguistic plainness. This is the age of the tweet and the internet meme; the soundbite, the status, the slogan. Everything reduced to its most basic components. Stripped back. Pared down. Even in the world of literature, where we might hope to find some linguistic luxury, we are flirting with a recessionary mood. Big books abound, but rhetorical largesse at the level of the sentence is a shrinking economy. There is a prevailing minimalist
sensibility in the twenty-first century.
Novel Style is driven by a conviction that elaborate writing opens up unique ways of thinking; crucial and enriching ways that are endangered when expression is reduced to its leanest possible forms. By re-examining the works of frequently misunderstood English stylists of the late twentieth century (Anthony Burgess, Angela Carter, Martin Amis), as well as a newer generation of twenty-first-century stylists (Zadie Smith, Nicola Barker, David Mitchell), Ben Masters argues for the
ethical power of stylistic flamboyance in fiction and demonstrates how being a stylist and an ethicist are one and the same thing.  A passionate championing of elaborate writing and close reading, Novel Style illuminates what it means to have style and how style can change us.
