  <title>The Writer&#39;s Journey of John Earl Stark 01 (Parody &amp; Satire) - R. L. Saunders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;John Earl Stark had a problem. If his book sales didn&amp;#39;t pick up, he&amp;#39;d have to go get a real job.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So he called an old friend, a fellow author just returned from a &amp;quot;digital rehab&amp;quot; and wanting to get back into the swing of writing.&lt;br /&gt;
Their styles and approaches were completely different. And each had nothing to lose by comparing notes with the other. Both of them needed a re-start at their &amp;quot;writing life&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, this was in between John&amp;#39;s playing amateur sleuth for his very feminine spirit-guides, and goddesses.&lt;br /&gt;
But his friend brought a couple of six-packs of &amp;quot;near-beer&amp;quot; so they could relax at John&amp;#39;s cabins and just open up about what did and didn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;br /&gt;
This is the beginning of their long discussions about how to write fiction and make a living at it - &lt;i&gt;or at least enough to enjoy a good life pecking at the keyboard....&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The First Four Rules - Excerpt:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Recently, I had an author return to my stable after a short dint in a &amp;quot;digital rehab&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
He was a bit more gaunt, a bit hollow-eyed, but calmer. He seemed to have lost a nervous &amp;quot;edge&amp;quot; that he&amp;#39;d always carried around - along with a sharply barbed wit that had a hair trigger.&lt;br /&gt;
His name is R. L. Saunders. Perhaps you&amp;#39;ve read some of his books. Maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;
He said he was back and he wanted to get back into writing. We both knew it wasn&amp;#39;t going to be easy. That &amp;quot;addiction&amp;quot; he went off to cure was also his crutch - the one he leaned on to write his satire and parodies.&lt;br /&gt;
So I gave him a job. We had a bunch of works around that needed to be polished up and re-cataloged and so forth. I figured that by having to read our other author&amp;#39;s works, maybe their style and approach would rub off on him. Maybe he&amp;#39;d be able to get some inspiration from their stories to build some new ones of his own.&lt;br /&gt;
He gave me a weak smile, a nod, and then found himself a desk in one of the back rooms.&lt;br /&gt;
Not too soon after, I got a note from one of my other authors, name of John Earl Stark. He asked if I knew any one to recommend - that could help him with his flagging sales.&lt;br /&gt;
A light bulb went off right then. I called up Saunders and told him that he needed to go out to interview this Stark fellow, that I&amp;#39;d be shipping a care package of materials out there with instructions on how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, I had to &amp;quot;loan&amp;quot; Saunders gas money to make the trip, and the use of my &amp;quot;Triple A&amp;quot; card in case his &amp;quot;beater&amp;quot; truck didn&amp;#39;t make it all the way.&lt;br /&gt;
Saunders was to write me a letter every week on their progress. And I sent an email to Stark saying that I was sending someone out - he just had to put the guy up and keep him fed.&lt;br /&gt;
By the time Stark replied, Saunders was well on his way.&lt;br /&gt;
Just yesterday, I got his the first report back.&lt;br /&gt;
