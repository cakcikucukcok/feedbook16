  <title>The Socratic Boogie - Felix Bendann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;The Socratic Boogie: Creating Creativity&lt;/B&gt; is a conversational dance between two speakers. They begin their dance trying to understand why the rationally scientific and the emotionally creative are always in mortal combat. Their serpentine route leads them to startling discoveries: that emotion is the most sophisticated of our mental processes; that creativity is the most primal emotion after self-preservation; that intuition is the foundation of creativity; that the creative self is not singular but plural; that the creativity that all humans possess can be accessed at will.
&lt;P&gt;Having drawn their road map of mental processing, the speakers then create methods for becoming intentionally creative whenever and wherever they choose to be. They are awed by the implications of their dialogic dance; however sophisticated the evolution of these methods, they can be used by anyone of high school age or older. The implications stagger them as they envision a society in which creativity is a useful everyday tool taught throughout the educational system.
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;The Socratic Boogie&lt;/B&gt; is home to myriad ideas from a number of disciplines. Its audience will come from all walks of life. Philosophers, artists, therapists, educators and college students, as well as any educated man-in-the-street will find this the book that irrevocably changed their lives. A user&#39;s guide is provided for readers who wish to focus on a part of the book -- such as creative methods -- rather than the whole.
&lt;P&gt; Get your toga and join the dance...
