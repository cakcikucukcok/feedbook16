  <title>Living in Spin - Andrew P. Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All the hard questions about human action 
        are about what to include in a story, 
        what can be left out, 
        and how to characterize what gets included.
    A narrative selects from all the world&#39;s motions 
        which ones are part of or relevant to an act, 
    and so narratives give us 
        what narratives have already shaped: 
        the relation is circular.
    Many narratives can be told of an act, 
        not all consistent.
    Some features of human action: 
    - events &quot;off-stage&quot; 
        determine what&#39;s happening &quot;on-stage&quot;;
    - many actions ``pass through&#39;&#39; motions in view;
    - an act can be changed after the fact;
    - action presupposes language;
    - what an act is can be highly ambiguous;
    - we judge acts (and narratives) 
        because we have a stake in them." />
