  <title>Yawn - Mary Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The incisive and often hilarious story of one of our most interesting cultural phenomena: boredom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the feeling your grandma told you was only experienced by boring people. Some people say they&#39;re dying of it; others claim to have killed because of it. It&#39;s a key component of depression, creativity, and sex-toy advertisements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s boredom, the subject of &lt;i&gt;Yawn&lt;/i&gt;, a delightful and at times moving take on the oft-derided emotion and how we deal with it. Deftly wrought from interviews, research, and personal experience, &lt;i&gt;Yawn &lt;/i&gt;follows Mary Mann&#39;s search through history for the truth about boredom, spanning the globe, introducing a varied cast of characters. The Desert Fathers--fourth-century Christian monks who made their homes far from civilization--offer the first recorded accounts of lethargy; Thomas Cook, grandfather of the tourism industry, provided escape from the mundane for England&#39;s working class; and contemporarily, we meet couples who are disenchanted by monogamous sex, deployed soldiers who seek entertainment and connection in porn, and prisoners held in solitary confinement, for whom boredom is a punishment for crimes they may or may not have committed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With sharp wit and impressive historical acumen, Mann tells the unexpected story of the hunt for a deeper understanding of boredom, in all its absurd, irritating, and inspiring splendor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
