  <title>Immigration - Evan Heasley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is a study on an issue which has a massive
impact upon The United Kingdom. In this short book
Evan briefly looks at how immigration has impacted the
UK. Discussion around the issue of immigration has descended
into name calling; if anyone has wanted to raise their concerns
they have been described as racist, narrow minded or bigoted.
This has led to a fear amongst the general population and some
politicians, which in turn has closed down any genuine open
debate regarding peoples concerns about the issue of open door
mass immigration. His desire is to start a dialogue which can
lead onto a genuine and frank debate around the problems mass
immigration has brought to the UK, and in time lead to proper
controls on who enters and lives in this country." />
