  <title>Greatest Habit - John Cornelius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A QUESTION: 
During a Masters of Education research project that compared the findings of two of the most important research projects into the nature of personal greatness - which sought to identify the key practices in the lives of the happiest, healthiest and highest achievers in history - one habit towered above all others, prayer. 
Yet according to Brandeis University, up to 90% of Americans pray and more than 50% pray daily. There&#39;s similar figures all around the world. There&#39;s actually no shortage of prayer; but there&#39;s a vast and distinct shortage of results. 
What makes the difference?
A CALLING: 
This question began to intrigue. If prayer is the greatest habit for living our best life - and the research overwhelmingly pointed that it is so - why is it that most that pray, live a life far below their real potential? 
True to the form of the research findings, much prayer was applied as looking over the studies, and a dangerous calling emerged:
&quot;Go into the wilderness for 40 days. Contemplate the principles of effective prayer and they shall be revealed. &quot;
A QUEST: 
For 40 days on the remote island of Tasmania - in total isolation, solitude and silence - nothing was done but to think about these principles. 
Stepping back from the mountain of researched ideas - the question of what makes prayer effective became a positive obsession, a subject of constant contemplation. The principles were distilled and set up into a logical and learnable system.
A PRACTICE: 
Returning back home, one more question still remained. That&#39;s all fine and good in theory, but what about in practice? Can these principles be learned and can they affect real changes? 
So with a select group of practitioners, the ideas were put into action. There results were outstanding. 
Here are the 7 most important principles." />
