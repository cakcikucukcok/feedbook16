  <title>A Comprehensive Guide to Bhagavad-Gita with Literal Translation - H.D. Goswami</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the late 18th century &lt;em&gt;Bhagavad-gita&lt;/em&gt; became the first Sanskrit work to be rendered in a European tongue, and since that time it has generated countless translations and secondary analyses.&amp;nbsp;Among these, however, H.D. Goswami&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Comprehensive Guide with Literal Translation&lt;/em&gt; excels in its capacity to schematize and summarize the &lt;em&gt;Gita&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s powerful appeal as a source of perennial wisdom.&amp;nbsp;With its sophisticated thematic approach, this &lt;em&gt;Comprehensive Guide &lt;/em&gt;brings clarity to the &lt;em&gt;Gita&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; content in a most thorough and systematic way, inviting both first-time and seasoned readers to vigorously engage with the text while enjoying the rewards of deep understanding. Especially impressive is the fact that this volume&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;not only provides the reader with a stimulating learning experience, but also serves as an exceptional reference book for specific topics.&amp;nbsp;Concise yet thorough, this skillful exposition, containing hundreds upon hundreds of key &lt;em&gt;Gita&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;references, affords a conceptual window into the core elements of Krishna&amp;#39;s teachings to Arjuna. Throughout this work we are graced by the knowledge, Sanskrit expertise and personal illuminations of one who is not only a highly trained scholar, but also a widely experienced spiritual teacher.&lt;/p&gt;" />
