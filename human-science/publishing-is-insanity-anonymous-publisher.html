  <title>Publishing Is Insanity - Anonymous Publisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book 1: Publishing has become an opportunity for many authors, stay-at-home dads, hard workers, narrators, cover designers, writers (different than authors I presume), and the like. However, evil giant companies (one in particular) are sucking the life out of customers and the creativity out of authors to feed their greed and crush competitors in unethical ways. After self-publishing for several years now, fulltime, and making more than an average fulltime living with it, I can attest to all the dirty secrets they are trying to keep from honest, average Joes behind the screen. This book is meant to shock you, but not with false information. All stories and quotes are based on true accounts from victims and experienced entrepreneurs. You will read, among others (here comes the list you can actually find on the content page):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- How one of the richest companies pays less taxes than you do, even though they make billions in profit.&lt;br /&gt;
- Why monopolies are hurting both customers and sellers in a lazy economy, and why we may be all doomed if we continue this way.&lt;br /&gt;
- Law transgressions and sleazy tricks the before-mentioned company has stolen money and/or market share to grow their monstrous empire.&lt;br /&gt;
- Why most positive reviews and star averages on the company&amp;#39;s enchanting website are actually fake, which makes a lot of sense if you really take the time to think about it.&lt;br /&gt;
- Money-making loopholes in a flawed system that can help you make tens of thousands of dollars extra (not kidding), because they&amp;#39;re too stupid or arrogant at headquarters to update their bots.&lt;br /&gt;
- Lies to the public, their loyal customers, and their diligent sellers.&lt;br /&gt;
- How E-Books, paperbacks on demand, and audiobooks have evolved over the years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On a different note, I hope you&amp;#39;re still happy and curious enough to click the &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; button. That way, I can be rewarded for the many hours I spent writing this stuff, and the willingness to reveal things nobody should actually know about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Book 2: Yes, you can make money self-publishing books. What do you think I&amp;#39;m doing now by putting this book out there?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, it&amp;#39;s not easy. In fact, it&amp;#39;s super stressful, heart-breaking, frustrating, and sometimes bordering insanity. The fake reviews, the high volume, the corrupted companies that own monopolic market shares... it all adds up. And then, if you expect to get paid and they suddenly decided to &amp;quot;investigate your account&amp;quot; and steal all your royalties, you need some kind of therapy. That therapy is writing it all down in a book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
May Azoo&amp;#39;s sins be exposed to the infernal depths of hell. May they rot in their filth and the income they have stolen from thousands and thousands of hardworking dropshippers, publishers, and more honest competitors. May the taxes we paid and they have received by playing evasive games be the nails to their coffin. The truth has been buried long enough. Each year, their sins of greed grow, and their insatiable, ruthless desire to crush their competitors and the very people who helped them grow their evil empire, expand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wish you well in your publishing and business endeavors. May these stories and warning signs guide you to estimate where the boundaries are, what you can get away with, and what will get you into trouble.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Written by a fulltime publisher who has achieved six figures in revenue for 4 consecutive years with online book-pumping, and in which 4 years 3 years were six figures in profit. Learn from the best. Go through hell and you will achieve the rest. Don&amp;#39;t be shocked. Good luck." />
