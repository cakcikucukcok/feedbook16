Effective stress management may also help maintain your overall health.   In this group program, you will learn skills to effectively manage your stress. These skills can be used to cope with stressful situations related to having had prostate cancer or with any other situation that may cause stress. You will address issues such as dealing with physical changes or communicating with your partner. Each group meeting also includes training in a relaxation method in order to help you reduce tension and stress.  By the end of the program, you will have a variety of techniques to choose from.   This workbook comes complete with homework exercises and monitoring forms to help you apply your new stress management skills. It also includes instructions for relaxation practice that will remain useful long after youve completed the program.
