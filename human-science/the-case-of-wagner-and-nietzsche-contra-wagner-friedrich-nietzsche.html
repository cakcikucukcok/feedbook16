  <title>The Case of Wagner and Nietzsche Contra Wagner - Friedrich Nietzsche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Case of Wagner&quot; is a critique of German composer Richard Wagner in which Friedrich Nietzsche makes a very public split with the musician. Nietzsche found himself at odds with Wagner&#39;s increasing involvement in the Völkisch movement and anti-Semitism. The critique of Wagner is something that is seen throughout Nietzsche&#39;s work, beginning with &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, wherein he praised Wagner as fulfilling a need in music to go beyond the analytic and dispassionate understanding of music. Further praise for the musician can be found in Nietzsche&#39;s essay &#39;Wagner at Bayreuth&#39;, contained in &quot;Untimely Meditations&quot;. However in &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot;, Nietzsche begins to express his disillusion with Wagner the composer and the man. &quot;The Case of Wagner&quot; was one of the last works authored by Nietzsche. It was followed by &quot;Nietzsche contra Wagner&quot;, also included in this edition, in which Nietzsche summarizes his criticisms of Wagner from his previous writings." />
