&lt;p&gt;The English and Chinese Translations Based on Laozis Original Daoism  From Philosophical and Hermeneutical Perspectives &lt;br&gt;
?????? ??????????? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your work on Lao Tzu promises to be very interesting. &lt;br&gt;
--Professor Sir Alfred Ayer (A.J.Ayer) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend to you a new translation of Lao Tzu from a very remarkable translator, a Chinese lady Lee Sun Chen Org, who deeply believes in the importance of this work for humanity. &lt;br&gt;
--Professor Sir Karl Popper &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should make an effort to let the world know of the true Laozi. I like both your Chinese and English translations of Daodejing. &lt;br&gt;
--Professor Chern Shiing-Shen????? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authentic philosophical Daoism was originated by Laozi through his meditation (private) and philosophizing(public). He has organized the piecemeal whimsical poetic thinking and incorporated them into his framework; that is the Daoism of Laozi. His book Daodejing embodies an integral frameworkand that should be tackled through philosophy. However, the language of his book is nearly four thousand years old; this hardship should be tackled through the Chinese hermeneutic. In addition, Laozis philosophical Daoism should be discerned from popular religious Daoism, a medley of fanciful thoughts and folklore. Accordingly, the single step to start the long and arduous journey to fathom the very deep wisdom of Laozi is to follow the roadmap of each individuals striving to understands oneself spiritually (self-realization) and the world scientifically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen Lee Sun(aka Lee Sun Chen Org): A self-taught and self-critical pursuer of truth as well as the meaning of life. She was a life-long follower of Laozis philosophy--Laoism, but attended Oxford University to study Western philosophy through winning a full scholarship awarded by Government in Taiwan. She has also worked for an MA on linguistics and Chinese hermeneutic in the University of California, Davis. Bertrand Ruseell had great influence on her in her early days. Later her mentor was A.J. Ayer. Most recently her philosophical thinking moved closer to Karl Poppers. Nevertheless Laozis thinking has had been her greatest influence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
