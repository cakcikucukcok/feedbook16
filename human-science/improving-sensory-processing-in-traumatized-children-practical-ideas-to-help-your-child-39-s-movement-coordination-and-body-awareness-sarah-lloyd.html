  <title>Improving Sensory Processing in Traumatized Children: Practical Ideas to Help Your Child&#39;s Movement, Coordination and Body Awareness - Sarah Lloyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Does your child struggle to know how their body is feeling?  Do they find it hard to balance or feel uneasy when their feet leave the ground?  Early trauma and neglect can have a profound effect upon a child&#39;s development.  Sensory integration theory offers a way of understanding how the brain processes and stores movement experience, and how these experiences manifest at a physical and emotional level. This book explains how early movement experiences affect brain development and gives examples of how trauma can prevent basic sensory processing pathways from being correctly established. It shows how you can identify gaps in normal sensory development and offers ideas for how you can use physical activities to help build up the underdeveloped systems.  Good bodily awareness forms the foundation of motor development as well as social and emotional skills and learning. This book will help your child to be more in tune with themselves and their bodies and feel more comfortable in their environment.    Highly accessible with lots of practical tips and examples, this book is written for adoptive and foster parents, and will also be useful for social workers, fostering and adoption workers and those working in primary and early years educational settings." />
