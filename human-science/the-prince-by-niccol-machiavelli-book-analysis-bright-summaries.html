The book proved highly controversial because of its descriptions of &#39;immoral&#39; behaviour and challenging of conventional religion, and gave rise to the term &#39;Machiavellian&#39; to refer to political deceit and duplicity. It is at the same time an important humanist work, and foreshadowed some of the political and philosophical ideas of the Enlightenment in Europe. Niccolò Machiavelli was a politician, diplomat and writer, and authored numerous political treatises, as well as plays, poetry and historical works.
