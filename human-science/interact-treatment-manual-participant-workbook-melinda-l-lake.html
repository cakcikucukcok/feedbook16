  <title>Interact Treatment Manual &amp; Participant Workbook - Melinda L. Lake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;PSYCHOLOGY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterACT Treatment Manual &amp; Participant Workbook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for Addictive Disorders based on the self-help &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;theory of Jim Maclaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melinda L. Lake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This treatment manual has been developed for health professionals working with people suffering from addictive disorders to develop a self-help recovery process. It includes practical session guides and worksheets for participants. It follows the therapy methods of author psychologist Melinda L. Lake, in which participants undertake all 15 sessions in sequence, ideally over a five day period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modules are best undertaken in a small group setting of 8 to 12, however are easily adapted for use in private practice. People suffering directly from addiction may also find this manual helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The InterACT Programme is a treatment protocol specifically targeting the addicted brain. It links the psycho-education of current neuroscience with cognitive therapy and the therapeutic principles of Acceptance Commitment Therapy. It is an inter-personal (group based) treatment method which lays the foundation for a solid self-help recovery process, and it moves participants through Prochaska &amp; DiClementes (1982) stages of change from a contemplative state to the maintenance stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It aims to break the pathological attachment to the intoxicated state and the various defensive processes that protect that attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach is based on the Interact Therapy Program devised by Psychologist Jim Maclaine in the 1980s. A programme that successfully treated thousands of patients with addictions and emotional disturbances for several decades in Australian accredited private hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;
