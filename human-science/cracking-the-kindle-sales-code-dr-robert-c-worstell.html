  <title>Cracking the Kindle Sales Code - Dr. Robert C. Worstell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Do you know your book will sell, or are you only hoping it does?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Successful authors know what most other authors don&amp;#39;t. They know that selling books on Amazon is a game, and it runs on code.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Successful authors have worked out how to crack that code and write books which are consistent bestsellers. Those books make them an annual 6-figure income in many cases.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the rest of Amazon authors run only on &amp;quot;&amp;quot;hope marketing.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They publish a single book and only hope it sells. They never get anywhere near a living income and keep their day job and minimal retirement pensions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They could have real financial freedom from their book royalties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But unsuccessful authors don&amp;#39;t know the rules to win the game of publishing. They don&amp;#39;t even know most of them. They don&amp;#39;t know how to crack the Sales Code that Amazon runs on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite all the books out there, very few deal with this exact point. Many are filled with distractions that slow your progress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
90% of successful self-published authors have solved three things:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How to write titles and descriptions that are what the readers are looking for, and&lt;br /&gt;
How to pick categories to place their books where readers expect to find them.&lt;br /&gt;
How to research your market before your write a single word.&lt;br /&gt;
The bulk of the authors out there are not successful because they do this backwards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They write a book they&amp;#39;ve always wanted to read, or one which they&amp;#39;ve always wanted to write.&lt;br /&gt;
Then they try to market it. Usually without having a clue of what to do to get there.&lt;br /&gt;
Once you decide to become successful you can learn how to do these things:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How to research for subjects that you like to write and readers like to buy.&lt;br /&gt;
Why using certain words can make customers fall in love with your story&lt;br /&gt;
How to create descriptions and titles that sell.&lt;br /&gt;
Smart, business-minded writers can future-proof their careers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They do this by:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turning their art into a logical, sustainable business&lt;br /&gt;
Getting their books almost automatically generating sales&lt;br /&gt;
Learning how to make money from your self-published books&lt;br /&gt;
Learning to increase your backlist and leverage your sales, even your book income&lt;br /&gt;
And building a successful indie publishing career&lt;br /&gt;
Now you&amp;#39;ll know you&amp;#39;ll be able to get it right. You&amp;#39;ll know how the code works and how to discover where readers are buying books, write the books that you enjoy writing and they enjoy reading, and present a polished product that sells routinely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That is the key to your Kindle book selling success.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And a small handful of authors do this every day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because they know Amazon isn&amp;#39;t a bookstore, it&amp;#39;s a search engine that also sells books (among many, many other things.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately, Amazon itself gives you the tools. You can find out what terms you need to include in your title and description to make this possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second best thing is that you&amp;#39;ve found the book that has all this in one place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here&amp;#39;s the chapter titles:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why Most Authors Can Only Hope Their Book Sells on Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;
What Keeps Your Books From Selling - They Can&amp;#39;t Be Found&lt;br /&gt;
How to Train Amazon to Recommend Your Book to Buyers&lt;br /&gt;
How to Author a Book That Amazon Wants to Sell For You&lt;br /&gt;
Writing A Decent Book (Is Not That Hard)&lt;br /&gt;
Can You Re-Kindle Book Sales?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The hard work has already been done. Just read it and apply it.&lt;br /&gt;
