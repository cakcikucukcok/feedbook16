  <title>The Wisdom of Psychopaths - Kevin Dutton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this engrossing journey into the lives of psychopaths and their infamously crafty behaviors, the renowned psychologist Kevin Dutton reveals that there is a scale of &quot;madness&quot; along which we all sit. Incorporating the latest advances in brain scanning and neuroscience, Dutton demonstrates that the brilliant neurosurgeon who lacks empathy has more in common with a Ted Bundy who kills for pleasure than we may wish to admit, and that a mugger in a dimly lit parking lot may well, in fact, have the same nerveless poise as a titan of industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dutton argues that there are indeed &quot;functional psychopaths&quot; among us--different from their murderous counterparts--who use their detached, unflinching, and charismatic personalities to succeed in mainstream society, and that shockingly, in some fields, the more &quot;psychopathic&quot; people are, the more likely they are to succeed. Dutton deconstructs this often misunderstood diagnosis through bold on-the-ground reporting and original scientific research as he mingles with the criminally insane in a high-security ward, shares a drink with one of the world&#39;s most successful con artists, and undergoes transcranial magnetic stimulation to discover firsthand exactly how it feels to see through the eyes of a psychopath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dutton develops his theory that we all possess psychopathic tendencies, he puts forward the argument that society as a whole is more psychopathic than ever: after all, psychopaths tend to be fearless, confident, charming, ruthless, and focused--qualities that are tailor-made for success in the twenty-first century. Provocative at every turn, &lt;i&gt;The Wisdom of Psychopaths &lt;/i&gt;is a riveting adventure that reveals that it&#39;s our much-maligned dark side that often conceals the trump cards of success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
