  <title>The Phonetic Guide to French - Matthew Lawry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book is about learning the phrases and sentences and getting to grips with saying the language, without going into the grammar first.&lt;/b&gt; In that way you can have fun in learning how to say certain things and also you do not come up against stumbling blocks and frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this thinking was because when I was a child my parents used to tell me words before they taught me how to do the alphabet, so I thought that was a better way round; get used to the language first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this book to how I thought the student of the language could assimilate and understand it and get a basic grounding of the language. I thought to myself, what was the best thing to learn first, for instance; what the difference between masculine and feminine; what does the accent mean, so I put this information in the chapter header pages so then I could use more space to actually learning the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also put in a conceptual stage so then you can think about the language for instance. English has quite a few routes to it, like Latin; so quite a few words are very similar, even though the accent can throw us off. It sounds like proper English for instance; catgorie which means category in French which is nearly the same in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there is no right or wrong way to learn; it depends on what you want it for; you may want to practise it on holiday or you may want to read the French newspapers, so sometimes you do not necessarily have to learn the alphabet or the grammar. I like to read newspapers on holiday and watch films in French; that is why I wanted to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I hope you enjoy this book as much as I have in writing it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
