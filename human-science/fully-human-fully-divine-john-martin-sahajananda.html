  <title>Fully Human- Fully Divine - John Martin Sahajananda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fully Human-Fully Divine: Integral Dynamic Monotheism, a Meeting Point between the Vedic Vision and the Vision of Christ is the latest book of John Martin Sahajananda. This books deals with finding the answer to the fundamental question: Who are human beings? He looks for the answer to this basic question in two categories of spiritual traditions, viz., prophetic tradition and wisdom tradition. The wisdom tradition seems to focus on our oneness with God and the prophetic tradition on our humanness. He proposes a view that integrates these two views in an inclusive way. We are fully human and also fully divine. He looks at spiritual life as a dynamic process of evolution in relationship with God. This process he describes as Integral Dynamic Monotheism. 
In the second part of the book, he explains to us about similarities between the spiritual awakening and spiritual evolution in the Vedic tradition and the biblical tradition. He shows how close these great traditions can come, and when they come close together, they realize what they need from one another to make them richer and fuller. 
Thus he says that the challenge of Upanishadic tradition to Christianity is to open the nondualistic experience of Jesus, which is the radical love of God for all the Christians. In the same way, the challenge of Christ to the Vedic tradition is to translate its nondualistic wisdom of God, which is the radical love of God, into nondualistic action and social transformation that is the radical love of ones neighbor." />
