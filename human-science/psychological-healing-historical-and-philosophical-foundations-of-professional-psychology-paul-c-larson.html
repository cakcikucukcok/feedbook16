  <title>Psychological Healing: Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Professional Psychology - Paul C. Larson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is intended as a text in the history and philosophy of professional psychology. It takes a broad view of psychological healing and traces the history of this endeavor from prehistoric times down to the present. The story should be useful not only to graduate students in professional psychology, but to others in the psycho-social or behavioral health fields. It emphasizes the importance of multicultural and diversity issues by covering a wide swath of relevant world history to help students understand the cultural matrix that is behind the many people we serve. America is a nation of immigrants and they bring with them the legacy of their varied backgrounds. A major metaphor is the stream of transmission. We practice based on what our teachers knew, we improve upon them, and in turn, pass them on to our students. This extended lineage of psychological healing can be summed in four archetypal roles: the shaman and priest, the physician, the teacher, and the scientist. Modern professional psychology incorporates all of those, and this book seeks to tell that story." />
