  <title>The Authentic Life - Victor Shane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Millennial Revolution&lt;/p&gt;: 
&lt;p&gt;As Baby Boomers retire and Generation X begins to fade, the baton will pass on to Millennials. Who are these Millennials? The truth be known they are among the most well-informed, gifted, and talented segment of the population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indications are that by the year 2020 about one third of the global population will be composed of Millennials. Meaning soon they will be the captains of industry, commerce, economy, government, law, education, etc.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Will they be able to get the planet earth unplugged from the matrix of futility? Will they be able to change the world and usher in sustainable elements of peace, freedom, and prosperity? The author believes the answer to these questions to be YES! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor Shane, in The Authentic Life, demonstrates that faith in Gods universal Providence is strengthened, not challenged, by knowing the science that underlies the workings of Gods created universe. Biblical faith and the discoveries in science are co-paths to discovering Gods active role in our lives, as stated in Psalm 19, The heavens proclaim the glory of God. This book should be read by every thinking Christian whether faithful, agnostic, or atheist.&lt;/p&gt;

					                        Jerusalem, Israel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;The Authentic Life by Victor Shane presents a clear message for millennials and for everyone about living life unplugged from the matrix of distractions and deceptions. Written in a clever and conversational style, Shane gives insight into both lifes big picture and practical take-aways for day-to-day living. Its a great book to read and to give to others. &lt;/p&gt;
