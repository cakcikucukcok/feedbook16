  <title>Transfer in Kashi and the River of Time - Bjorg Bjarnadottir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="TRANSFER in Kashi and the River of Time is a travelogue written during a visit to Kashi aka Varanasi--the eternal City of Light on the banks of the timeless Ganges river in India. Spirituality pulsates here and life and death are celebrated every day where the crossing or transfer between different realms is an ongoing process.
The passing of a loved one plays a dominant role; the author takes on a pilgrimage to Kashi to come to terms with the grief she suffered at the passing of her father in 2012. Her father had been brought up in a Christian household in North Iceland but with a multireligious twist due to his mothers interest in India, contemplative studies, and yoga. 
In this record of discoveries and experiences on her visit to Kashi and drawing on examples from her dream journal while in India, the author reflects on the ancient teachings of the evolution of consciousness--some of which originated in Kashi--and the role of contemplation and dreams in that progress for profound transformation of the whole being. At the same time, enhancing the sense of self and nourishing the relationship with the centre of being for consolation and oneness.
A young boy of eight has the humble dream of becoming an animal tamer; animals and animal deities are everywhere in Kashi. 
This is the story of a path when embarking on a new future." />
