  <title>Walt Whitman&#39;s Language Experiment - James Perrin Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Combining intellectual history with literary analysis, this study of Whitman&#39;s language experiment from 1855 to 1892 offers a refreshing new look at his theory of language especially the English language in America&amp;mdash;as an expression of a &amp;quot;national spirit&amp;quot; and relates that theory to the language and style of Whitman&#39;s major poems and essays. Whitman viewed American English as the most expressive, poetic language that ever existed, and he used his studies of historical linguistics to corroborate that view. Part 1 explicates the theory of language that Whitman developed in his linguistic notebooks, unpublished manuscripts, fugitive essays, and two chapters of the popular book R&lt;em&gt;ambles Among Words&lt;/em&gt;. The diction and syntax of the 1855&amp;ndash;1856 editions of &lt;em&gt;Leaves of Grass&lt;/em&gt; are analyzed to show how Whitman&#39;s overwhelming interest in language theories resulted in the &amp;quot;language experiment&amp;quot; of the poems. Part 2 examines the ways in which Whitman&#39;s view of language as an expression of the constantly evolving spirit of America subtly shifted to a more cumulative, backward-looking vision of linguistic and spiritual change. Analysis of the diction, syntax, and organization of the last four editions of &lt;em&gt;Leaves of Grass&lt;/em&gt; reveals how this shift in vision affected the style of Whitman&#39;s poetry and prose from 1860 to 1892. Whitman&#39;s groundbreaking poetic style, the author concludes, was a direct consequence of his view of language and the human spirit as dynamic, progressivist, and actively changing within a temporal world. Conversely, Whitman&#39;s experiments in both prose and poetry helped confirm his view of linguistic and spiritual evolution.&lt;/p&gt;" />
