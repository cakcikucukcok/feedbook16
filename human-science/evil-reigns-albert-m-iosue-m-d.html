  <title>Evil Reigns - Albert M. Iosue M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are 7.5 billion people alive today; millions more have lived, all having experienced the phenomena of mind and consciousness. The Library of Congress contains more than thirty-two million books, of which thousands are about the human mind. Because of the nature of language, no consensus has been reached as to what mind is and how it is related to the brain. In the last few hundred years, evil elements of the human mind have become dominant. An evolutionary development is unfolding as we live. We are an integral part of it. For all of mankind, it has both promise and great danger. 
This book offers a simple, clear, and functional conception of the human mind. It explains why human beings have become the most amazing creatures, performing miracles with material, and yet the most dishonest and cruel animal that ever lived. We have eaten heavily from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Now we threaten the very lives of all that live upon the Earth." />
