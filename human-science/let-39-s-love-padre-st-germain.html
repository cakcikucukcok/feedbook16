  <title>Let&#39;s Love - Padre St. Germain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love, the essential ingredient that binds everything bringing a whole new fathom to our respective lives. We have yet to truly scratch the surface or even digest or comprehend its alluring everlasting power. 
In our childhood, we are all attracted by the big book that yields simple defining words beside the colourful images that are designed to prepare us for life. These fascinating colours and words will reign forever in our conscience. 
I have tried to capture that youthful book element and hope that it holds with the readers attention. That the words and photos ring true to the aspects o our beautiful life within the auspices of love. 
From an early age I was mentored by a great man, wise and humble in his approach to life. He felt it his duty to inform me that the sole purpose of life was about each individual identifying themselves with the love. Further still, that life without the love essence was wasteful and meaningless, that we should essentially be educated in the art of love. 
I strove in my own haphazard way to understand eventually, absorbing some of his remarks and pondering long and hard on them. The end result is a book striking in its wording and illustrated images, as I have attempted to encompass every facet of the life that is love. I hope that my own words accompanied with the photos contain an imaginative, invigorating, political and philosophical element, some of which are humorous but all laced with the undercurrent of love." />
