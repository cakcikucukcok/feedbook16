  <title>Slavoj Zizek - Ian Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;When I read Ian Parker&#39;s manuscript, I experienced an underlying solidarity: despite obvious differences, we share the same basic political concerns and visions. And this makes his critical remarks always pertinent!&#39; Slavoj Zizek
&#39;This is not simply the best critical introduction to Zizek – in a much more radical sense, this is the only critical introduction to Zizek. Parker&#39;s study is much more than an important contribution to the ongoing debate: it redefines its very terms.&#39; Yannis Stavrakakis, author of &#39;Lacan and the Political&#39;
&#39;A sharp, clear and radical analysis.&#39; Christian Ingo Lenz Dunker, Professor of Psychoanalytic Theory and Lacanian Psychoanalyst, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Since the publication of his first book in English in 1989, Slavoj Zizek has quickly become one of the most widely read and contentious intellectuals alive today. With dazzling wit and tremendous creativity he has produced innovative and challenging explorations of Lacan, Hegel and Marx, and used his insights to exhilarating effect in analyses of popular culture.
While Zizek is always engaging, he is also elusive and even contradictory. It can be very hard to finally determine where he stands on a particular issue. Is Zizek Marxist or Post-Marxist? How seriously should we take his recent turn to Christianity?
Slavoj Zizek: A Critical Introduction shows the reader a clear path through the twists and turns of Zizek&#39;s writings. Ian Parker takes Zizek&#39;s treatment of Hegel, Lacan and Marx in turn and outlines and assesses Zizek&#39;s interpretation and extension of these thinkers&#39; theories. While Parker is never hastily dismissive of Zizek&#39;s innovations, he remains critical throughout, aware that the energy of Zizek&#39;s writing can be bewitching and beguiling as well as engaging and profound." />
