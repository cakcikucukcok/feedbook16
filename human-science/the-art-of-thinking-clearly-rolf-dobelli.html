  <title>The Art of Thinking Clearly - Rolf Dobelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Invested time in something that, in hindsight, just wasn&amp;#39;t worth it?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Paid too much in an eBay auction?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Continued to do something you knew was bad for you?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Sold stocks too late, or too early?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Taken credit for success, but blamed failure on external circumstances?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;  Backed the wrong horse?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are examples of what the author calls cognitive biases, simple errors all of us make in day-to-day thinking. But by knowing what they are and how to identify them, we can avoid them and make better choices: whether in dealing with personal problems or business negotiations, trying to save money or earn profits, or merely working out what we really want in life&amp;#8212;and strategizing the best way to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already an international bestseller, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Thinking Clearly&lt;/em&gt; distills cutting-edge research from behavioral economics, psychology, and neuroscience into a clever, practical guide for anyone who&amp;#39;s ever wanted to be wiser and make better decisions. A novelist, thinker, and entrepreneur, Rolf Dobelli deftly shows that in order to lead happier, more prosperous lives, we don&amp;#39;t need extra cunning, new ideas, shiny gadgets, or more frantic hyperactivity&amp;#8212;all we need is less irrationality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple, clear, and always surprising, this indispensable book will change the way you think and transform your decision making&amp;#8212;at work, at home, every day. From why you shouldn&amp;#39;t accept a free drink to why you should walk out of a movie you don&amp;#39;t like, from why it&amp;#39;s so hard to predict the future to why you shouldn&amp;#39;t watch the news, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Thinking Clearly&lt;/em&gt; helps solve the puzzle of human reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
