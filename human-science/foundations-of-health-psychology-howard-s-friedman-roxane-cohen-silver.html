  <title>Foundations of Health Psychology - Howard S. Friedman, Roxane Cohen Silver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Health psychology is the scientific study of psychological processes related to health and health care.  Although the field is only 25 years old, it has burgeoned into a major scientific and clinical discipline.  Health psychology has excellent scientific journals, thousands of scientists and practitioners, and many students.  Yet, there has not been a sufficient statement or explication of the foundational concepts upon which this flourishing field is built.   Foundations of Health Psychology brings together top experts to provide a much-needed conceptual base for this rapidly expanding field. Rather than take a medical model approach, the volume examines health psychology from a theoretical, conceptual, and psychological perspective.  After presenting an overview of the fields history and methods, the contributors address core concepts of the biopsychosocial approach to health and then discuss applications to health promotion and illness prevention and treatment.  Providing a deep understanding of the intellectual foundations of health psychology, this volume will be invaluable for both new and experienced researchers, as well as students and other scholars seeking a firm basis for successful research and practice." />
