  <title>Upon This Rock, Revival of the Five-Fold Ministry - Dr. Michael P. Sterling Phd.D.D, Dr. Paula Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Upon This Rock I will Build My Church
Jesus says in Matthew 16:18, And I say also unto thee, that
thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. It was this divine
revelation of Jesus being the Christ (Messiah, Anointed One),
Son of the Living God, which gave Peter access to the keys of the
kingdom. It is by this same revelation that a young monk named
Marin Luther would declare and understand that the just shall
live by faith, thus beginning a reformation of the church.
This book is designed to continue the process of reformation,
as in the 16th Century, where a partial reformation began to take
place. Martin Luther, who we now realize was a prophet in his
own right, was given a doctorate of theology at the University of
Wittenberg (Germany) by the Electon Frederick, Duke of Saxony.
This degree Staupitius was conferred upon him in October 19,
18 Dr. Michael P. Sterling
1512. This divine revelation caused him to speak boldly against
certain indulgences, such as one could buy a soul from purgatory
for ten shillings and not a farthing less. This indulgence was
prefabricated in pretense by Pope Leo X, who succeeded after
Julius II. This Pope Leo X imposed such ridiculous practices on
the pretense of raising money for war against the Turks. Martin
Luther began to oppose the Pope, much like a latter day Amos,
who came to Bethel and heralded against King Jeroboam, King
of Israel, and Amaziah, the Priest of Bethel. This prophet, Martin
Luther, began the genesis of reformation. Martin Luther also
was the first to translate the New Testament into the German
language, which was September 1522. He studied the works
of Desiderius Erasmus who prepared important new Latin and
Greek editions of the New Testament. Martin Luther also finished
the Pentateuch in 1523, thus completing the entire bible and
publishing it in 1530. As we examine history we find that Martin
Luther was a step ahead of William Tyndale. His great defiance
was enacted as he nailed the 95th Thesis of Contention to the
Wittenberg church door, as he declared his intolerance against
the Roman Catholic corruption on Halloween night 1517. Martin
Luther died of natural causes although he was branded a heretic
by the Catholic Church. William Tyndale was not so lucky, and
was burned at the stake in the public square (1596).
Upon This Rock, Revival of the Five-Fold Ministry 19
As we examine church history we see a clear picture of
martyrdom. And in its wake men like John Wycliffe, who was
called the morning star of the Reformation era, who 200 years
prior criticized abuses and false teaching in the Catholic Church.
Yes, John Wycliffe, a professor at Oxford University, was expelled
from his teaching position by the Pope, who also after his death
exhumed his bones and had them burned. This is the price of
Reformation. Let us examine for a brief moment John Huss, using
Foxes Book of Martyrs as our source. John Huss was chosen as
the pastor of the Church of Bethlehem in Prague. He also held a
position as the Dean of Students and Rector at the University. He
along with John Wycliffe were known as the pre-reformers. His
teaching and revelation upset the pope, and he was also burned
at the stake like so many spirit filled saints of the time period. It
is noted in historical data that John Huss was heard singing in
the midst of the flames as he went on to glory." />
