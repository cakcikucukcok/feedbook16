  <title>Managing Your Childs Chronic Pain - Tonya M. Palermo, Emily F. Law</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Madeline is a 15-year-old girl with abdominal pain and headaches that occur most days of the week. Because of her pain, she has missed 99 days of school this year and is no longer able to play volleyball. Her parents have taken her to see a number of specialists and she has tried many different medications but she has not experienced any improvement in her pain...    Studies suggest that as many as four out of ten children and adolescents suffer from chronic pain. The causes of chronic pain in young people vary, from illness-related causes to pain following medical procedures. In fact, in some children the cause of chronic pain is never explained.   Managing Your Childs Chronic Pain is an invaluable resource for parents who wish to learn how to help their children and families cope with persisting pain using cutting-edge, scientifically proven treatment tools and techniques. The easy-to-implement strategies in this book provide parents with practical instructions for pain management that will enable children to return to school, participate in sports and other activities, and pursue healthy and active social lives. With guidance on how to prevent relapse, maintain improvements, and prevent future problems with pain and disability, Managing Your Childs Chronic Pain will empower parents to take a hands-on approach to relieving their childs pain." />
