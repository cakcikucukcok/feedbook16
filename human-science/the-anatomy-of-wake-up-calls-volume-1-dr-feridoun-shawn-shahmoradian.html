  <title>The Anatomy of Wake-Up Calls Volume 1 - Dr. Feridoun Shawn Shahmoradian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This collection of essays asks tough questions about religion, poverty, and human interactions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each essay is meant to be read separately, and they cover everything from terrorism and God, to the afterlife and freedomand much more. While a connecting link might not be immediately apparent, as a whole, the essays will help readers grasp wisdom.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In Killing in the Name of Allah (God), the author takes aim at religious fanatics, writing, 
You act as if the omnipotent God, our omnipresent Father, is somehow the predecessor or successor of Genghis Khan, hovering over the innocent as if he were the commander of hatred and suffering. You act as if our God is a warlord, demonic and ferocious, extending his arm through your bloodied sleeves, upholding celestial rules and the laws of divinity through violence.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In Thoughts about God, he writes, The most important self-defense move that you can ever make is to believe in and seek God. In a consumer-oriented society that is intensely materially based, profit is becoming the sole purpose and is replacing God in peoples hearts.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gain insights on spirituality, existence, and the nature of good and evil with The Anatomy of Wake-up Calls.&lt;/p&gt;" />
