  <title>Staying One: Leader&#39;s Guide: How to Avoid a Make-Believe Marriage - Clinton W. McLemore, Anna McLemore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marriage is the most demanding and potentially rewarding relationship for many adults. Learning to navigate its challenges can be difficult. Staying One is a practical guide that not only teaches the spiritual what and why of marriage but also provides advice and practice in the how. Intended to save readers from the pain of learning the hard way, it illustrates and explains biblically sound approaches to building a healthy and fulfilling marriage that lasts. These include things married people should and shouldn&#39;t say to each other.   Staying One will prove useful to pastors in their pre-marital counseling and to the couples they are ministering. It will serve as powerful source material for marriage enrichment workshops, retreats focused on marriage, and church-based growth groups and adult education classes. The book will prove of special interest to engaged couples, newlyweds, those wanting to revitalize their marriages, and married people on the brink of divorce. A key feature is that each chapter concludes with a response from the author&#39;s wife, reflecting a woman&#39;s point of view.   We also offer a Workbook for use in completing the twenty hands-on activities contained in Staying One, as well as a comprehensive Leader&#39;s Guide for those facilitating workshops based on the book." />
