  <title>What Every Parent Needs to Know About - Tonja Krautter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Identification and understanding of the emerging sexual trends among our youth can leave a family feeling frustrated, frightened, confused, and defeated. We have a new sexual movement occurring in our culture.  We are witnessing first hand a dramatic cultural shift in regards to sex and sexual relationships.  It is important that we become educated about it.  The sexual trends that are emerging in our society are alarming to say the least. However, perhaps what is even more alarming is the fact that most adults are unaware that they exist.  What Every Parent Needs to Know About Emerging Sexual Trends Among our Youth, by Dr. Tonja H. Krautter, focuses on what the trends are and why we are seeing them emerge in our society.  In addition, the book focuses on how to avoid the emergence of these trends and how to deal with them if a child is currently engaging in sexual activity. The book will provide answers to the many commonly asked questions by parents regarding what to do if their minor child is thinking about sex or is already engaging in sexual activity.   It is my hope that upon completion of the book, every reader will have a more thorough understanding of the complexities of our culture&#39;s emerging sexual trends and therefore, be better equipped to work toward prevention and intervention.  By acknowledging the dramatic shift that we are witnessing, we as a society will be afforded the opportunity to help our children in both positive and healthy ways not only in regards to sex, but in all areas of their lives." />
