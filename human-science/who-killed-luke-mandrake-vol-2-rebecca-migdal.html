  <title>Who Killed Luke Mandrake? Vol. 2 - Rebecca Migdal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Trapped in a zombie body and with a vulture chained to his arm, ex-alive punk rock icon Luke Mandrake roams the earth longing to recover his true form. Only then will he have a shot at rekindling the love of the voluptuous goddess he met in Famebeau, a weird limbo for the famous. Who knows, maybe he can even arrange a threesome with his widow, the adorable and feisty Charity Ball. At his own funeral, Luke learns that a vicious drug dealer and a drunk sleuth are stalking his wife and threatening the kids. Oh yeah, and he has somehow unwittingly sparked an all-out war between the sexes among the gods. Maybe it has something to do with that affair he had with the Queen of the Dead? All Luke knows is, now Hades wants to destroy him, and is using as bait Rosetta Stone, a lovely singer Luke once fancied, and whose psychic dreams connect her to Luke.&lt;/p&gt;" />
