  <title>New Light - Samanandha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="New Light takes a look at the atheistic philosophies of big bang and evolution without being intimidated by the hostile pressure built by media, celebrities, scientists and intelligentsia. All of us have gone to schools and colleges but can we recollect what the books had to say about the following topics:- the big bang threw out matter but where did that matter originally come from? how did the Laws of Physics and Chemistry get created? how did the stellar bodies build themselves when all around us we only see existing things breaking down? how did the first ever plant cell find food and how exactly did it reproduce itself? why dont we see spontaneous generation of life happening anywhere in the world? how did butterflies design their beautiful and symmetrical patterns? which part of the body did animals use to think before they created a brain for themselves? why do we have zero knowledge about our bodies and have to go to schools and colleges to find out the same, when actually, we should know all these things by heart since we have evolved i.e. created our bodies? These are important questions but the books just rush through these portions. We are bullied into silence by the words science and scientific and accept these theories by faith without subjecting them to critical analysis. New Light is an attempt to find out the truth about the world around us undeterred by the dogma of the most rigid religion of all - atheism." />
