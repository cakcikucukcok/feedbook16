  <title>Fear : Psychological Study of the Causes and Effects - James Sully, Charles Richet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;What  are the causes and effects of fear among human and all beings capable  of feeling it?  What are the signs of fear and the physical phenomena  that accompany it?  &lt;br/&gt;
Fear acts in two ways. At times it paralyzes and makes motionless; at other times it excites and gives extraordinary strength.  &lt;br/&gt;
Fear  is, finally, a protection against death. But salutary as it is, and  inspired by nature, the feeling is one that must be energetically  contended against, because it is an emotion of the lower class which it  is necessary to try to dominate and make submissive to the moral  conditions of our existence. We should try to conquer ourselves, and  replace the notions of terror by the higher ideas which will perhaps  triumph over fear, of self-forgetfulness, abnegation, duty.&lt;/span&gt;
