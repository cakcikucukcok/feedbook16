  <title>Roberta’S Papers on the Psychology of Aging - Roberta Provenzano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Roberta Provenzano believed the study of psychology should ultimately bring more happiness to the world. A deep thinker, she focused particularly on aging. Her collected articles on the subject propose to show that the myths and stereotypes of deterioration and senility associated with old age are based on preconceived notions rather than fact. She shows that, in spite of some physical limitations, the elderly, who are now in greater proportion in our society than ever before, can participate actively and constructively in their communities.
This collection, published in honor of Provenzano, addresses age-related topics with an expertise that seems more relevant as time passes. It explores myths and stereotypes imposed upon the elderly, biological aspects of aging, psychological aspects of aging, and sociological aspects of aging
Relying on scientific studies, Provenzano highlights how older people come to terms with specific conditions of aging. Quoting the adage You are as old as you feel, she infers that aging does not necessarily mean defeat and decline, but can instead be a rewarding experience of personal fulfillment and social contribution." />
