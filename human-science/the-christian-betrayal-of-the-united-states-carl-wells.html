  <title>The Christian Betrayal of the United States - Carl Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Christian Betrayal of the United States&lt;/i&gt; theorizes that 100% of the problems of the United States have their root in the conservative, Bible-believing Christian church of this country.&lt;br&gt; Countless books by liberal Christians or by non-Christians, have accused the &quot;Christian right&quot; of being a dangerous segment of our country. Following the principles of the Christian right will lead to tyranny, so the theory goes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Christian Betrayal of the United States&lt;/i&gt; takes a very different tack. According to the author, the Bible-believing Christians have betrayed their country already--by their actions in many distinct arenas of life. Those who have cursed the Bible-believing Christians as being too Christian, have got it exactly backward. They may curse Christians again, when they understand that Christians were not Christian enough.&lt;br&gt; The author, far from being a liberal Christian or a humanist, is a self-professed conservative, Bible-believing Christian. He strives to show how his own people have betrayed their nation. &lt;br&gt; It is a dark story. On the brighter side, the author also tries to grope toward a solution of the problems he and his people have caused.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;" />
