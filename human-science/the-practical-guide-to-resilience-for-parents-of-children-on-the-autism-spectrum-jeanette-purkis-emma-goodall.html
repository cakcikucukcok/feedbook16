  <title>The Practical Guide to Resilience for Parents of Children on the Autism Spectrum - Jeanette Purkis, Emma Goodall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the challenges around a diagnosis of autism in a young person is that it can unintentionally lead to dependence and a lack of resilience and confidence. Children and young people with autism have the capacity to be independent and resilient which can help them live independently or be supported to live a fulfilling life. The crucial work of building these skills in children with autism can begin at a very young age; the earlier the process starts the better.
This book empowers parents of autistic children aged two to ten to help them promote resilience in their child.
Full of activities, this practical resource will help guide parents on how to build the foundations of resilience and independence in their children. It includes information about the main developmental stages for children on the autism spectrum, and will take parents through life events and milestones at different ages and identify where difficulties and barriers to resilience may arise and how to address them. This is a must-have resource for any parent who wants to effectively build resilience and independence in their child." />
