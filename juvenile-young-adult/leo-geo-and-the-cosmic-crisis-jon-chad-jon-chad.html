      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Intrepid explorer Leo Geo is working in his lab at the Fizzmont institute when he learns that a comet is on a collision course with his brother Matt Data&#39;s space station. Without a moment to lose, he grabs his trusty computer, leaps into a rocket, and launches into space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astronomer Matt Data is working in his lab at the space station when he learns that his brother Leo Geo&#39;s computer is about to suffer a malfunction and turn evil.
