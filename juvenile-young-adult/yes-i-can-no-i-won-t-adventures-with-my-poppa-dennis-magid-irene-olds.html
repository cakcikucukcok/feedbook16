  <title>Yes I Can! No I Won’T! Adventures with My Poppa! - Dennis Magid, Irene Olds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Liney is a very active, mischievous four-year-old boy from Brooklyn who loves making even routine tasks fun.  Two stories highlight the joys of childhood in this fast-paced book.
In the first story, a pasta-covered Liney refuses to take a bath and have his hair washed until Poppa tells him that if he doesnt, he wont be able to receive a special surprise.
When Liney climbs into the bathtub, he finds himself in rough ocean waters with a pirate ship bearing down on him. As Liney fights for his crew, Poppa goes about giving him his bath and shampoo  and cheering his efforts.
In the second story, Liney wants to join Poppa watering the flowers, and he learns to make different sprays with the hose. When he surprises Poppa by starting a water fight, a no holds barred, winner take all battle ensues!
Youll laugh out loud as you read the stories, which are combined with wonderful pictures that show how much fun childhood can be when its packed with the love and adventure of two strong-willed, unforgettable characters." />
