  <title>Five Times Revenge - Lindsay Eland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Five unlikely friends. Two bullies. One epic prank. Part &lt;em&gt;The Breakfast Club&lt;/em&gt; and part &lt;em&gt;The View from Saturday&lt;/em&gt;, this funny, heartwarming novel about friendship and standing up for yourself will appeal to fans of Chris Grabenstein and Jennifer L. Holm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam is the prank mastermind. Perk is his best friend and the computer genius. Pearl is the prettiest girl in school&amp;#8212;and a violin prodigy. Ray looks like a big dumb jock, but he secretly wants to be an engineer. And Dutch is the often-bullied dork who is in tune with everyone&amp;#8217;s feelings. The five of them couldn&amp;#8217;t be more different. But there&amp;#8217;s one thing they have in common: they are fed up with Hill Parmar, the school bully&amp;#8212;and his dad, their school principal who&amp;#8217;s always turning a blind eye. When Hill finally steps over the line, the five unlikely schemers band together for a prank like their middle school has never seen. Lindsay Eland weaves the five alternate points-of-view together for an accessible and funny school story&amp;#8212;and a friendship story&amp;#8212;for every reader.&lt;/p&gt;" />
