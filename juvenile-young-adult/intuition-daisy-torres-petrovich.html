  <title>Intuition - Daisy Torres-Petrovich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever since humankind gained the concept of time, dreamers have sought a
way to travel within its limitless shores. They fantasized about the ability to
go back in time to right an injustice or go forward in time to explore humanitys
potential, but for most, it remained just thata fantasy. For these rare few, those
dreams become an obsession, for there are no boundaries within the varied
dimensions that are part of this wonder. However, none of these attempts has
been successful because of the lack of spirituality necessary to conquer this
skill, to be able to will the spirit long enough to exist outside of the physical body
 until now.
Esperanza Mia is content with her lifethat is, until she is introduced to an
experiment that changed the world she knew. On that day, she learns of her
special gift, spectacular abilities she never imagined possessing. She is on the
verge of learning the secret that had been zealously kept for many generations. A
blue-eyed stranger appeared to ensure her success in fulfilling her destiny, and
with him a torrent of emotions invaded her soul.
What is the meaning of the spiritual walkers arrival? How will her choices
determine the fulfillment of prophecies written throughout human history?
Few beings have discovered how to bend or squeeze time. Fewer have learned the
consequences of doing so. Will Esperanza be able to do both and survive?" />
