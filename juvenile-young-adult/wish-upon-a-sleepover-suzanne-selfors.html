  <title>Wish Upon a Sleepover - Suzanne Selfors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author Suzanne Selfors brings heart and humor to this middle grade novel about a group of misfits who find true friendship where they least expect it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five misfits. One magical wish.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leilani dreams of being friends with the most popular girls in her class--the Haileys--who are always throwing awesome themed sleepovers. She devises a master plan: throw her own sleepover of the century and invite them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Tutu, her grandmother, accidentally mails Leilani&#39;s invitations to the DO NOT INVITE list, the best sleepover in the history of the world becomes the &lt;i&gt;worst&lt;/i&gt;. Instead of the Haileys, the only guests are the three kids Leilani definitely did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; want to show up: the neighbor who never speaks, the girl who draws mean pictures of her, and her farting older cousin. At least her best friend August will be there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leilani and her guests decide to make Tutu&#39;s recipe for Sleepover Soup, which requires each of them to collect one ingredient that has significant meaning in their lives. They embark on a scavenger hunt that reveals unexpected surprises. What Leilani finds is not what she wanted, but it might just be even better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Imprint Book&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Big-hearted, fast-paced, and funny.&quot; --Kim Baker, author of &lt;i&gt;Pickle&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;Equal parts heartbreaking, hopeful and hilarious. It&#39;s impossible not to cheer for these unlikely heroes&quot; --Sara Nickerson, author of&lt;i&gt; The Secrets of Blueberries, Brothers, Moose &amp; Me &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;Anyone who&#39;s ever felt different from the crowd will relish this story of kids who find the magic of being their own unique selves--together.&quot; --Sundee T. Frazier, author of the Coretta Scott King Award-winner &lt;i&gt;Brendan Buckley&#39;s Universe and Everything In It &lt;/i&gt;and the Cleo Edison Oliver series &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Huzzah for Suzanne Selfors! By turns humorous and poignant, this terrific book was impossible to put down.&quot; --Suzanne Williams, coauthor of the Goddess&lt;/p&gt;" />
