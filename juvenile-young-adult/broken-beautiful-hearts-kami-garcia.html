  <title>Broken Beautiful Hearts - Kami Garcia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling author Kami Garcia comes a red-hot romance that will break your heart and put it back together again. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Her heart has to break before it can open.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When star soccer player Peyton Rios receives an offer from her first-choice college, senior year starts off exactly as planned. But when Peyton uncovers her boyfriend&#39;s dark secret, she confronts him--and finds herself falling down a flight of stairs. Peyton&#39;s knee--and maybe her dream of going pro--is shattered. Everyone is talking: Was she pushed, or did she fall? Peyton knows the truth, even if no one believes her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He has to let someone in before it&#39;s too late.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her future on the line, Peyton goes to stay with her uncle in a small Tennessee town to focus on her recovery. Dating is the last thing on her mind--until she meets sweet, sexy Owen Law.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Peyton doesn&#39;t trust her heart, especially when she senses that Owen is hiding something. When their secrets are finally exposed, Peyton has to decide if love is worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Imprint Book &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Garcia has become synonymous with a certain breed of drama-filled, &lt;b&gt;compulsively readable romance&lt;/b&gt;.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Bustle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Something wonderful happened to me as I read this--I fell in love. &lt;/b&gt;Genuine, shattering, deep, heart-pounding love.&quot; --Jennifer Niven, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of&lt;i&gt; All the Bright Places&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Holding Up the Universe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;A slow burn that squeezes your heart so tightly you can&#39;t breathe&lt;/b&gt; . . . until it explodes, and you&#39;re left with a beautiful story that will draw you back again and again.&quot;--Abbi Glines, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Field Party series and the Rosemary Beach novels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Kami Garcia knows the anatomy of the teenage heart&lt;/b&gt;--what makes it race, what makes it break, and what makes it mend.
