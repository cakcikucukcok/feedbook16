  <title>Cindy Kitten’S Adventures - Cynthia Rachal-Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I  was born, Cynthia Lynn Bennett, in Central Louisiana. Where, I later married, my best friend. Our children are doing well. We made Louisiana our home. Where our, three children and two grand kids live. The grand kids are growing like weeds. Working in my flower bed is relaxing. A little dirt never hurt anybody. There is not anytime for sewing lately. The feeling, of knowing, you made it yourself is great. Its good for the soul. When, we have figs, I make Strawberry fig preserves. They are tasty good, with hot homemade biscuits. My stories are about many things. My love cats and kittens. I realized there were many stray cats around. Sometimes they just wander, from house to house. They hunted mice, in the hay barn. Cats wander like free spirits. We gave them nick names. Sassy kitten she was gray. They played, on the porch. I named a few like gray boy, snowball and Mama Cat. I would rock, on the porch trying to play with them. Every cat had a bowl. There was one brave kitten. I named her, Cindy kitten. There fore Cindy kittens Adventures were born. Hope my stories about Cindy kitten and her friends, make you smile. Cindy kitten has more adventures for you. Enjoy reading my stories, until our next adventure." />
