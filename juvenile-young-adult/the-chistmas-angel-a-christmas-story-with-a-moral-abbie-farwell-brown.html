Miss Terry had tossed each toy one by one to the snowy sidewalk in front of her house. But her heart is moved when she sees &lt;b&gt;the Christmas Angel&lt;/b&gt; kicked aside. Remembering all the years it graced her family mantel, she rushes to rescue it. Back inside, the Christmas Angel comes to life, and reveals the actual destiny for each toy, and for Miss Terry, something she could have never imagined.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Christmas Angel,&amp;quot; part of the Focus on the Family Great Stories collection, includes an in-depth introduction and discussion questions by Joe Wheeler. It is a stirring reminder of what really matters at Christmas and throughout the year.&lt;br /&gt;
