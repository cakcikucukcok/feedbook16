A deeply satisfying and beautiful book.&amp;#8221; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elana K. Arnold, National Book Award finalist and author of &lt;em&gt;The Question of Miracles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie O&amp;#8217;Reilly is an only child. Which is why it makes everyone uncomfortable when he talks about his brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liam. His eight-year-old kid brother, who, up until a year ago, slept in the bunk above Charlie, took pride in being as annoying as possible, and was the only person who could make Charlie laugh until it hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came the morning when the bunk, and Liam, disappeared forever. No one even remembers him&amp;#8212;not Charlie&amp;#8217;s mother, who has been lost in her own troubles; and not Charlie&amp;#8217;s father, who is gone frequently on business trips. The only person who believes Charlie is his best friend, Ana&amp;#8212;even if she has no memory of Liam, she is as determined as Charlie is to figure out what happened to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search seems hopeless&amp;#8212;until Charlie receives a mysterious note, written in Liam&amp;#8217;s handwriting. The note leads Charlie and Ana to make some profound discoveries about&amp;#160;a magic they didn&amp;#8217;t know existed, and they soon realize that if they&#39;re going to save Liam, they may need to risk being forgotten themselves, forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca K.S. Ansari&amp;#8217;s debut novel is a stunning contemporary fantasy about love, loss, and the power to forgive that we all have inside us&amp;#8212;even if we sometimes forget that it&amp;#8217;s there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
