  <title>The Fairy Princess Alexa Gets Lost - Dr. Amber M. Valinski, Kenn Yapsangco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was inspired by and created for my own little princess. At the age of fifteen months my Alexa was a very social child who loved waving and talking to everyone. Like all parents I wanted to warn her of the dangers of going off with strangers without scaring her. At the time I started reading this book to her she was probably too young to fully get the significance of the story. However, we will continue to read this book from time to time so we remember to talk to her and all kids about how to be safe if they get lost or approached by strangers. I hope that you enjoyed the book and took the time to write your own phone number in the page as the Fairy Queens tracker, and remember that talking to kids is always the best way to prepare them." />
