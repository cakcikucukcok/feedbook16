  <title>Cosmic - Frank Cottrell Boyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Liam has always felt a bit like he&#39;s stuck between two worlds. This isprimarily because he&#39;s a twelve-year-old kid who looks like he&#39;s about thirty. Sometimes it&#39;s not so bad, like when his new principal mistakes him for a teacher on the first day of school or when he convinces a car dealer to let him take a Porsche out on a test drive. But mostly it&#39;s just frustrating, being a kid trapped in an adult world. And so he decides to flip things around. Liam cons his way onto the first spaceship to take civilians into space, a special flight for a group of kids and an adult chaperone, and he is going as the adult chaperone. It&#39;s not long before Liam, along with his friends, is stuck between two worlds again&amp;#8212;only this time he&#39;s 239,000 miles from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Cottrell Boyce, author of &lt;em&gt;Millions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Framed,&lt;/em&gt; brings us a funny and touching story of the many ways in which grown-upness is truly wasted on grown-ups.&lt;/p&gt;" />
