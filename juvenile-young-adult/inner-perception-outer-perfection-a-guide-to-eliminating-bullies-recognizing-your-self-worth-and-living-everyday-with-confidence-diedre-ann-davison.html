All of this happened to me before the age of fourteen.&quot; - Inner Perception, Outer Perfection A Guide To Eliminating Bullies, Recognizing Your Self Worth, And Living Everyday With Confidence.  I struggled most of my teen age years with bullies, insecurity, and depression. It wasn&#39;t until the age of seventeen that I was taught the metaphysical tools that changed my life forever.

This book provides instructions on how to create the life you want,restore your confidence, and how to love yourself." />
