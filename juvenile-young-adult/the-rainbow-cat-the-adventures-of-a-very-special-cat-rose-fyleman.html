  <title>THE RAINBOW CAT - The Adventures of a Very Special Cat - Rose Fyleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Rainbow Cat is not in the least like any cat you have ever seen. You see, it is a fairy cat, so it rather had to be different. It&amp;rsquo;s outward appearance is simply magical, if not somewhat unusual. You see it had a violet nose, indigo eyes, pale blue ears, green front legs, a yellow body, orange back legs and a red tail. In fact, it was coloured with all the colours of the rainbow, and so was known as the Rainbow Cat. Of course, it had to live in Fairyland (well where else would you find a Rainbow Cat?) and it had all sorts of really strange adventures. In this book I am going to tell you some of them, and I think you will agree that it really had a very exciting and breathtaking time.&lt;br /&gt;
What were these adventures you ask? Well, you will have to download this book and find out for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;

Rose Amy Fyleman (1877-1957) was an English writer and poet, noted for her works on the fairy folk, for children.&lt;br /&gt;
