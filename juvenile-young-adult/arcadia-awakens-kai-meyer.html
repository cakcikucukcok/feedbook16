  <title>Arcadia Awakens - Kai Meyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Despite inciting their families&amp;#39; wrath and putting themselves in grave danger, rival clan leaders Rosa Alcantara and Alessandro Carnevare refuse to give up on their love for each other. But when the young couple suffers a deadly attack from an unknown enemy, it soon becomes clear their strong feelings can&amp;#39;t keep the past from haunting them. On the run from their adversaries and searching for answers, Rosa and Alessandro begin to unravel the secret behind the conspiracy to keep them apart: an ancient prophecy that predicted the destruction of all Arcadia if the two rival dynasties ever married and bore children. And now, they must outrun those who think they&amp;#39;re better off dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Arcadian assassins trying to kill them at every turn, a group of hybrid beasts thirsty for their blood, and the ruler of all Arcadia desperate to find them, Rosa and Alessandro must find out the truth behind Arcadia once and for all. But will it be the key to unlocking their freedom and future together, or the final step in bringing them to their knees?&lt;/p&gt;" />
