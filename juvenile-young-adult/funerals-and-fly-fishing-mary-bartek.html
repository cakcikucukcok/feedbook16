  <title>Funerals and Fly Fishing - Mary Bartek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I start up the street toward my grandfather&#39;s house. Just how weird is it that I, Brad Stanislawski, am walking toward a funeral home of my own free will?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where do you fit in when you&#39;re oversized, underappreciated, and faced with a name like Stanislawski?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Stanislawski is looking forward to summer vacation, if only to get away from the classmates who make fun of his size (it&#39;s not his fault he&#39;s so tall) and his last name (Stan-is-lousy being their moniker of choice). So when Brad&#39;s mother announces that she&#39;s taking a summer vacation by herself and sending Brad across the country to stay with his estranged grandfather-who happens to be an undertaker-Brad thinks life couldn&#39;t possibly get any worse. Still, as Brad ought to know, first impressions can be deceiving, and a name can hold a lot more than embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What exactly does it mean to be Brad Stanislawski? In this thoughtful, funny first novel, Brad (with a little help from his grandfather) is about to find out for himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Funerals and Fly Fishing&lt;/i&gt; is a 2005 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
