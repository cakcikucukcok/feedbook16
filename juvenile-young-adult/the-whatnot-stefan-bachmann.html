  <title>The Whatnot - Stefan Bachmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Whatnot&lt;/em&gt; is the acclaimed international bestseller and sequel to Stefan Bachmann&amp;#39;s riveting debut novel, &lt;em&gt;The Peculiar&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; called &amp;#34;an absolute treat for readers of any age,&amp;#34; and which the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; compared to &amp;#34;Dostoevsky&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Crime and Punishment&lt;/em&gt;, Charles Dickens&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;A Tale of Two Cities&lt;/em&gt;, and more recent classics, such as J. K. Rowling&amp;#39;s Harry Potter and Lemony Snicket&amp;#39;s A Series of Unfortunate Events.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve-year-old Pikey Thomas is missing an eye, a family, and friends of any sort. One day, running from bigger boys set on bullying him, Pikey finds himself in front of a grand, beautiful house. There he meets and helps a black-winged faery who is injured. It&amp;#39;s a small gesture of kindness and bravery in steam-powered Victorian London, where faeries, now banned, are on the run or imprisoned; where the human armies are preparing for war; and where the changeling Bartholomew Kettle, aided by Arthur Jelliby, still searches for his missing sister, Hettie. This is the epic, dark, imaginative, unforgettable, and ultimately hopeful sequel to Stefan Bachmann&amp;#39;s acclaimed debut novel, &lt;em&gt;The Peculiar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;An enthralling read . . . Bachmann combines the pleasures of a Dickensian cast of characters with the eldritch qualities of British faerie lore and adds a touch of steampunk to entice readers into an alternate universe in which the English are on the verge of war with the fay. The breathtaking beauty of his prose is coupled with a plot that also leaves his audience breathless.&amp;#34;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
