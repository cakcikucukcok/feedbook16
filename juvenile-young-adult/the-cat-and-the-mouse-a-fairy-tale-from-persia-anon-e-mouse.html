  <title>THE CAT AND THE MOUSE - A Fairy Tale from Persia - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 324&lt;br /&gt;
In this 311th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Persian Fairy Tale - &amp;quot;THE CAT AND MOUSE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, a long, long ago and far, far away, there once lived in the Persian city of Kerman a cat like unto a dragon&amp;mdash;a longsighted cat who hunted like a lion; a cat with fascinating eyes and long whiskers and sharp teeth. Its body was like a drum, it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful fur like ermine skin. Nobody was happier than this cat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perceiving the wine cellar open, one day, the cat ran gleefully into it to see if he could catch a mouse, and hid himself behind a wine jar. At that moment a mouse ran out of a hole in the wall, quickly climbed the jar, and putting his head into it, drank so long and so deeply that he became drunk, talked very stupidly, and fancied he was as bold as a lion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Where is the cat?&amp;quot; shouted he, &amp;quot;that I may off with his head. I would cut off his head as if on the battlefield. A cat in front of me would fare worse than any dog who might happen to cross my path.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
The cat ground his teeth with rage while hearing this. Quicker than the eye could follow, he made a spring, seized the mouse in his claws&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you may ask? Was the mouse sober enough to fulfil his boast, or was the cat thinking bigger, like his master, thinking of empire building? But it takes a lot of energy and wisdom to create and run an empire. Was the cat wise enough to succeed or was he outsmarted by the mice? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
