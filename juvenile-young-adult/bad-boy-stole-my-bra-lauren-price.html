  <title>Bad Boy Stole My Bra - Lauren Price</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine waking up in the middle of the night to find your new neighbour dangling out of your window. And not only is he dangling out of your window, he&amp;rsquo;s also clutching your tattiest bra in his hand. What. The. Actual. Fudge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When notorious bad boy and new kid on the block, Alec Wilde, moves in next door to Riley, sparks fly. Alec is everything that Riley despises &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;s cocky, obnoxious and annoyingly handsome &amp;ndash; and after their &amp;lsquo;unconventional&amp;rsquo; introduction, Riley is determined to get her own back. Alec picked the wrong girl&amp;rsquo;s bra to steal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A furious prank war ensues, and it&amp;rsquo;s clear Alec has met his match in Riley. But behind the playful give-and-take, Riley is barely holding it together. Her family is struggling to cope after her cousin&amp;rsquo;s death, her cheating ex-boyfriend is back in town and maybe, just maybe, she&amp;rsquo;d like more from Alec than banter and practical jokes. But how can Riley get through to the real him when she can&amp;rsquo;t even take herself seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An authentic, sharp-eyed take on the twists and turns of teenage life. Hilarious and heart-warming, &lt;em&gt;Bad Boy&lt;/em&gt; is perfect for lovers of quirky, laugh-out-loud rom-coms&lt;/p&gt;" />
