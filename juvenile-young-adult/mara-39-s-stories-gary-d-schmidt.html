  <title>Mara&#39;s Stories - Gary D. Schmidt</title>

They are stories of light and hope and freedom, stories of despair and stories of miracles, stories of expected pain and stories of unexpected joy--all told in the darkness of the concentration camp barracks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through extensive research noted in the back of the book, Gary Schmidt has skillfully woven together stories from such sources as the Jewish religious scholar, Martin Buber, Holocaust survivor, Elie Wiesel; and folklorists, Steve Zeitlin and Yaffa Eliach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combining lore of the past with tales born in the concentration camps, Mara&#39;s stories speak to us from a time that must never be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;" />
