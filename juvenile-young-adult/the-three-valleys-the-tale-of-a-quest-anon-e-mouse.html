  <title>THE THREE VALLEYS - The tale of a quest - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 353&lt;br /&gt;
In this 353th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE THREE VALLEYS&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long time ago and far, far away, there lived a Count, who had many castles and estates, and a most beautiful daughter, but no one would associate with him, for it was rumoured he was in league with the Evil One; indeed, from time to time one or other of his servants most mysteriously disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last who disappeared was the shepherd. One evening he did not return to the castle. Search was made for him throughout the village, but in vain; no trace of him could be found. After this no one would enter the Count&amp;#39;s service as shepherd; but at last, a bold, handsome youth presented himself; he had travelled far as a soldier, and cared nothing for evil spirits. The Count immediately engaged him, and said he could take the sheep to feed wherever he liked, only he must never go into the three valleys to the east of the castle. For a time all went well; the young man drove the sheep into the rich meadows around the castle as his master had ordered, and led a very comfortable life. But he was always thinking of the three valleys, and being a brave youth who did not fear evil spirits, he one day took the cross-bow and bolts he had used when soldiering, put a new string to his bow, and said, as he struck his rusty spear against the ground:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I will see who will venture to harm me in the three valleys; it will fare badly with him, I think.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Well, what happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some silly, some fun and some very serious. Did the youth make it to the Three Valleys and what did he find there? More importantly did he make it out? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
