  <title>Past Continuous - K. Ryer Breese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ade Patience has done what he was told he couldn&#39;t. He&#39;s broken the rules, used his powers to save a life. And no good deed goes unpunished. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior year finds Ade and his girlfriend, Vauxhall, deeply in love, indulging themselves with wild dates and exploring their newly strengthened abilities. Only Ade isn&#39;t as happy as he should be. He&#39;s got an itch that he can&#39;t seem to scratch and it has everything to do with his joining the Pandora Crew, a group of radical oracles hell-bent on disturbing the peace, performing &lt;i&gt;Jackass&lt;/i&gt;-style stunts, and spreading the mayhem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ade realizes that his involvement with the Pandora Crew is due to his absorbing some of Jimi Ministry&#39;s abusive childhood, he discovers that the only way to rid himself of the infectious memories is to erase his past. And it just so happens that the one guy who can do that lives a few blocks down the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure works. The &quot;Jimi cancer&quot; is cleared out. But when Ade returns to his life, he finds that changing the past has changed the present. Vauxhall has no idea who he is and he has to woo her all over again. And it won&#39;t be easy. There are three other people vying for Vauxhall&#39;s attention. Three other guys he has to literally battle to win her back. The worst part: they&#39;re all twisted versions of Ade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erasing the past has dramatically altered the present and Ade must join forces with his former rival to defeat . . . himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
