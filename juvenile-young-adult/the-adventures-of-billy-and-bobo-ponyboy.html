  <title>The Adventures of Billy and Bobo - Ponyboy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Ponyboy and I am the very proud father of three amazing children of my own who are all in their own rights my inspirations. Though I have been writing since I was old enough to take pen and paper in hand The Adventures of Billy And Bobo &quot;The Camping Trip&quot; is my first work to be published of which my family is so very proud. I was born in Lake Charles Louisiana but have lived in and traveled to many different states and cities across America enabling me to meet literally hundreds of people from all walks of life. As a result my experiences, both personal and social, throughout my life even to this day have contributed to and parallel the various stories to be told in the forty volume book series of this boy and his beloved sheepdog. It is my hope that children and parents alike may find themselves growing ever so much closer together as they relive and enjoy the comedic yet heartfelt situations experienced by Billy And Bobo along with their family and many friends. May true lessons of life, love and friendships be learned by all who hear the wonderful tellings of my stories for generations to come of this kind and gentle child called Billy and his carefree and rambunctious dog Bobo. May the sounds of children&#39;s laughter and empathy fill rooms across this great land as each of you embark on the next anticipated Adventures Of Billy And Bobo." />
