  <title>The Adventures of Finley and Cisco - Lisa Ozalis-Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Finley the fish moves from his school in Lake Erie to a new school in Lake Superior, he finds out the hard way that his new classmates think he is far from superior. An incident with a fishing hook when he was young left him with a pin holding his dorsal fin in place.  The other fish make fun of the way he looks and tell him to go back to Lake Erie because he looks different and doesn&#39;t belong there.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Adventures of Finley and Cisco&quot; is a triumphant tale that introduces children to the virtues of helping a friend in need (FIN) and the strength of power in numbers (PIN) in a fun-to-read adventure that is easy to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story offers many talking points and can be used by teachers, parents and counselors as a tool to help open up the delicate and necessary conversation of bullying, tolerance of and appreciation for those that are different, and the importance of standing up for what is right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the fish at Lake Superior School learn a valuable lesson about friendship, courage, forgiveness and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having over 15 years of working with children with special needs I&#39;m grateful and impressed with your ability to create such a touching children&#39;s book. There is no doubt that your book will help children of many ages deal with social and emotional issues. The Adventures of Finley and Cisco is realistic, versatile and has an effective lesson that teaches children it is okay to be different and that bullying is not ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Andrews, Director of Special Services School &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Worker Southampton Township School District&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s nothing fishy about this book!  Parents and educators alike will enjoy sharing this anti-bullying tale with young children.
