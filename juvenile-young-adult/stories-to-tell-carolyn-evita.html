  <title>Stories to Tell - Carolyn Evita</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Something has been lost since the myth and legend has been hijacked by the mainstream media. The storytellers of old have been replaced by corporations who assimilate everything into fantasy. This could be nothing further from the truth. Through story, most if not all cultures pass on from generation to generation stories pertaining to how we interact with nature and others through the highest of morals and respect. With the vilification of this, it is up to the elders of cultures to make sure these stories infiltrate into the collective heart of our children, guiding them and allowing them to make their way through life with integrity. As we enter the twenty-first century, our childrens future is in peril, with an oversexualised media and mass marketing for all the wrong reasons.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book of stories follows the life of a young girl whose imagination is healthy and very active, of her interaction with nature and the nature spirits, to raising children of her own and passing on sacred information to her siblings.&lt;/P&gt;" />
