  <title>The Shadow Girl - Jennifer Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I forget for an hour or two that she&#39;s with me. Sometimes I convince myself that she was only a dream. Or that I&#39;m crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For as long as Lily Winston can remember, she has never been alone. Iris, a shadowy figure who mimics Lily&#39;s movements and whispers in her ear, is with her always&amp;#8212;but invisible to the rest of the world. Iris is Lily&#39;s secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Lily&#39;s father is killed in a tragic accident, his cryptic final words suggest that he and Lily&#39;s mother have been keeping secrets of their own. Suddenly, Iris begins pushing Lily more than ever, possessing her thoughts and urging her to put together the pieces of a strange puzzle her father left behind. As she searches for answers, Lily finds herself drawn to Ty Collier, a mysterious new boy in town. Together, Lily and Ty must untangle a web of deception to discover the truth about her family, Iris&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;. and Lily&#39;s own identity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
