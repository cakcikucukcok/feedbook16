  <title>How to Quit Your Crush - Amy Fellner Dominy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mai Senn knows Anthony Adams is no good for her - no matter how hard she might crush on him. She&#39;s valedictorian; he&#39;s a surf bum. She&#39;s got plans, he&#39;s got his art. Complete opposites in every way. Vinegar and baking soda, they once joked. A chemical reaction that bubbled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, they bubbled. Maybe still do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good thing Anthony&#39;s got the perfect plan: two weeks to prove just how not good they are together. Whoever can come up with the worst date--something the other will seriously hate, proving how incompatible they truly are--wins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like taking a snake-phobe to the Reptile House at the zoo (his idea).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or a cooking class where they don&#39;t even get to eat the food (her idea).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s all about the competition, and it&#39;s meant to help them finally crush their crushes. But it wasn&#39;t supposed to be so hot. Or so fun. And when Mai&#39;s future becomes at stake, will she be able to do the right thing and quit Anthony forever?&lt;/p&gt;" />
