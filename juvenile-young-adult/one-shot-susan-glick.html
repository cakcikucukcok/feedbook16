  <title>One Shot - Susan Glick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A wonderfully realized coming-of-age novel about the emergence of an artist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lorrie reached for her camera. Okay, this was it. She lifted the camera to her eye. The woman was now sobbing, her shoulders heaving up and down. A man, crying too, stepped over and cradled her in his arms. Lorrie wondered who they were crying for. A son? A brother? A neighborhood boy?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lorrie lowered the camera. The shot was there, but she couldn&#39;t take it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lorrie Taylor is looking forward to lazing away the long summer days with Sarah, who&#39;s been her best friend since childhood. But Sarah&#39;s working at the riding stables and has little time to spend lounging by the pool. The cute stable manager, Thomas, seems interested in Lorrie, but even his welcome attention doesn&#39;t make up for the fact that she feels lost in her own hometown. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Lorrie lands a job with renowned photographer Molly Price, who has become a recluse. The prickly old woman isn&#39;t the easiest person to get along with, but her photographs touch Lorrie deeply. With Molly&#39;s encouragement, Lorrie begins to shoot and print her own pictures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As her abilities develop, Lorrie comes to realize that technical skill is not enough. Her search for that one perfect shot proves much more difficult than she ever imagined--and much more rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;" />
