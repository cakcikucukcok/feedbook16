Printz Award winner John Corey Whaley calls it &amp;#8220;not just a love story, but one with a ferocious pulse.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Quinn&amp;#8217;s boyfriend, Trent, dies in an accident their junior year, she reaches out to the recipients of his donated organs in hopes of picking up the fragments of her now-unrecognizable life. But whoever received Trent&amp;#8217;s heart has chosen to remain silent. The essence of a person, Quinn has always believed, is in the heart.
