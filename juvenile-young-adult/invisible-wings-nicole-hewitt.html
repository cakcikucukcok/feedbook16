  <title>Invisible Wings - Nicole Hewitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A swift evilness comes over the lands from the north destroying all peoples and places before it. As countries and empires tarry and fall many lose hope. As the first book in The Edge of a Sword series readers are introduced to a world of shrinking magic and growing peril. Elves, humans and half-bloods struggle to live together and to resist the evil armies descending from the north. Once the world looked to the elvin-fairies, a magical race of tall winged beings but with them deceased for over a hundred years hope dwindles. As countries fall and the darkness spreads heroes rise and stand strong while they can, delaying the coming storm with strength of will and sheer desperation. Yet all know these are only delays in steady losses. 
Sylvia Gruith of Larentra is of an ancient line of magical beings; this is her blessing and her curse. While she has magical powers beyond that of the current world she also struggles to live in hiding because such power can easily be misused. From a queenly figure as the High Lady of Larentra to a terrified victim of evil men, she desperately hides for fear of her life and her future.
Derik is a rogue soldier traveling with a mage and his young apprentice hoping to make up for a shadowy past. When the trio encounters the frightened woman Derik becomes determined to protect her whether she likes it or not despite the cost. Secrets are revealed, relationships grow and disaster strikes! This new, unlikely couple must navigate a way to survive or risk perishing alone. If they can just make it through these struggles they hope for a clear path to the weighty goal of saving the world from impending doom. 
While few know about Sylvia the few that do hope she will be the key to solve the turmoil of the world. However, the frightened young woman is no match for what she will face. Furthermore to forward their plans her secrets must be broadcast to the world, a cost Sylvia is unwilling to pay." />
