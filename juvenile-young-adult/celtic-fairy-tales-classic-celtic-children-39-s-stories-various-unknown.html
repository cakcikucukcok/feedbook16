  <title>Celtic Fairy Tales - Classic Celtic Children&#39;s Stories - Various Unknown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the end of his highly successful &lt;i&gt;English Fairy Tales, &lt;/i&gt;Joseph Jacobs compiled &lt;i&gt;Celtic Fairy Tales&lt;/i&gt;, a book of 26 Celtic children&amp;rsquo;s stories from around Wales and Ireland. &lt;i&gt;Celtic Fairy Tales &lt;/i&gt;tells of horned women, breweries of eggshells, sprightly tailors, gold and silver trees, King o&amp;rsquo; Toole&amp;rsquo;s goose, sea maidens, and so much more. Of particular interest is the 13th century true legend of Beth Gellert, wherein the dog of Llewelyn (I) the Great, Prince of Wales, protected the prince&amp;rsquo;s infant son from a wolf attack while Llewelyn was out on a hunt. A memorial to the dog still stands today in the village of Beddgelert, near Mount Snowdon, Wales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In an attempt to give a library of the Celts&amp;rsquo; wealthy imagination to his readers, Joseph Jacobs has attempted to begin the readers&amp;rsquo; captivity with the earliest recordings of these tales. And captivate he does&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Celtic Fairy Tales &lt;/i&gt;not only preserves a cultural history, but also is richly entertaining, especially to young minds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While some of the themes found in Celtic folklore are similar to those of contemporary fairy tales, other stories in this collection are infused with flavours that are uniquely Celtic. Celtic folklore overflows with vivid stories that fire the imagination. &amp;nbsp;In Jacobs&amp;rsquo; own words, &amp;ldquo;The Celts went forth to battle, but they always fell. Yet the captive Celt has enslaved his captor in the realm of imagination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We invite you to curl up with this unique sliver of Celtic folklore not seen in print for over a century; immerse yourself in the tales and fables of yesteryear.&lt;br /&gt;
