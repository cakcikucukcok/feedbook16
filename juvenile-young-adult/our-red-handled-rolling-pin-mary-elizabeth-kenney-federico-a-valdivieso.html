  <title>Our Red-Handled Rolling Pin - Mary Elizabeth Kenney, Federico A. Valdivieso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mary Elizabeths story begins at the kitchen table where she loves to have tea parties. As she pours from a fragile china pot, she listens to her mother tell cherished tales about her Grandma Mary Rose who was known for making the flakiest pie crust in all of Jersey City, using her red-handled wooden rolling pin.
Through stories of her grandmothers knack for baking, Mary recognizes a strong connection through her own childhood concoctions that include Irish shortbread. After Mary matures, marries, and has children of her own, she recognizes the lure of the kitchen and its importance in family relationships that span four generations as she gently guides her daughters hands that hold the worn red handles of her grandmothers rolling pin.
Our Red-Handled Rolling Pin shares a poignant story for children, that reflects on heartfelt memories and a grandmothers love of baking to encourage little ones to carry on family traditions in the kitchen." />
