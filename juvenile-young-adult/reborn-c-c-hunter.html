  <title>Reborn - C. C. Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Enter Shadow Falls: After Dark&lt;i&gt; and meet a vampire named Della, who&#39;s about to discover what her own story is meant to be. . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Della  had the perfect life-the family, a boyfriend, and a bright future-until  she was turned, and abandoned by everyone she loves. She takes refuge  at Shadow Falls, a camp for teens with paranormal powers. It&#39;s where she  and her best friends, Kylie and Miranda, heal their heartbreak with  laughter, and where Della is training to be a paranormal  investigator-and she refuses to be distracted. That means there&#39;s no  time for romance with Steve, a gorgeous shapeshifter whose kisses melt  her heart.   When a new vampire named Chase shows up at camp, Della&#39;s  world is thrown into even more chaos. Arrogant and annoyingly sexy,  Chase is a mystery . . . and the only mystery Della likes is one she can  solve. She can&#39;t solve Chase, at least not while she&#39;s dealing with  ghostly hauntings, vampire gangs and a web of family secrets. Can she  prove herself as an investigator and keep her life-and her heart-intact?  From bestselling author C. C. Hunter comes &lt;i&gt;Reborn&lt;/i&gt;, the first book in a new series set once more in the world of Shadow Falls.&lt;/p&gt;" />
