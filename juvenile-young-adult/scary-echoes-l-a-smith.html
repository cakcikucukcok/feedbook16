  <title>Scary Echoes: - L   A Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This little book is quite different from other children&amp;rsquo;s books. I have combined fact with fiction. The story takes us back to the 1950&amp;rsquo;s, and focuses on two young boys living on a farm in outback Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a story of things that really do go bump in the night. Of a mountain lake and its magical voices, scary voices, amplified by the great thunderhead storms that form above the lake. And the journey six brave young boys undertake to experience these magical voices for themselves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We start with a short history lesson, and among the topics discussed are several creatures and inventions uniquely Australian. I have also added many of my own childhood / life experiences; hopefully my experiences will enhance the readers understanding of the information presented in both the educational element of the book and the fictional story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gathered all my information online, and let me say, referencing information from online searches is far more complicated than referencing a book. And due to the popularity of the internet for sourcing information, I have added footnotes and a bibliography; hopefully this addition will offer the reader some insight into how to reference internet material.&lt;/p&gt;" />
