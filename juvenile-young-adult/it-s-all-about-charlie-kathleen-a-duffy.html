  <title>It’S All About Charlie - Kathleen A. Duffy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charlie is a loner, and he likes it that way. He grew up as an only cat and has developed very set ideas about how his world should be and how others should behave in it. But when circumstances force him to rescue a newborn kitten, his orderly world crumbles around him. Charlie is now a single parent, with all the emotional ups and downs that parenthood can bring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new situation, Charlie finds strengths within himself that he never dreamed he had. The old life he lived disappears, and a new one unfoldsone that is bigger, fuller, and better. Charlie experiences the joys of a life of giving and receiving unconditional love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Wonderfully enchanting to watch Charlie have a change of heart and personality to become a hero to a little kitten. Charlies transformation warms the heart!   K. Finneron, author of SuSu of the FruFru &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This absolutely charming and heart-warming childrens story about Charlie the Cat and how he redeems his selfish ways will resonate with children and adults alike. Like all great stories, its easy to read, full of laugh-out-loud bits, and is hard to forget.   Jane Buckle, PhD, London, UK&lt;/p&gt;" />
