  <title>Out of Place - Jennifer Blecher, Merrilee Liddiard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When twelve-year-old Cove Bernstein becomes the target of a school-wide bullying campaign, she sets out to find a way to leave her&amp;#160;home on&amp;#160;Martha&amp;#8217;s Vineyard for New York City, where her best friend lives. But Cove discovers that friends can appear in the unlikeliest places, and maybe home isn&amp;#8217;t the worst place to be after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Blecher&amp;#8217;s debut novel is a voice-driven story about bullying, friendship, and self-reliance that hits the sweet spot for fans of Ali Benjamin&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Thing About Jellyfish&lt;/em&gt; and Erin Entrada Kelly&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;You Go First.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve-year-old Cove Bernstein&amp;#8217;s year has gone from bad to worse. First, her best friend, Nina, moved from Martha&amp;#8217;s Vineyard to New York City. Then, without Nina around, Cove became the target of a bullying campaign at school. Escape seems impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But opportunities can appear when you least expect them. Cove&amp;#8217;s visit to a secondhand clothing store leads her to a surprising chance to visit Nina, but only if she can win a coveted place in a kids-only design competition. Cove doesn&amp;#8217;t know how to sew, but her friend at the retirement home, Anna, has promised to teach her. And things start really looking up when a new kid at school, Jack, begins appearing everywhere Cove goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Cove makes a big mistake. One that could ruin every good thing that has happened to her this year. One that she doesn&amp;#8217;t know how to undo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Blecher&amp;#8217;s accessible and&amp;#160;beautifully written debut novel explores actions and consequences, loneliness, bullying, and finding your voice. This voice-driven friendship story is for fans of Rebecca Stead&amp;#8217;s&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Goodbye Stranger&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;and Jodi Kendall&amp;#8217;s&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Unlikely Story of a Pig in the City.&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Includes black-and-white spot art throughout. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
