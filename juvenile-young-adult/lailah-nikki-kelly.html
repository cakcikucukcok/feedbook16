  <title>Lailah - Nikki Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The girl knows she&#39;s different. She doesn&#39;t age. She has no family. She has visions of a past life, but no clear clues as to what she is, or where she comes from. But there is a face in her dreams - a light that breaks through the darkness. She knows his name is Gabriel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On her way home from work, the girl encounters an injured stranger whose name is Jonah. Soon, she will understand that Jonah belongs to a generation of Vampires that serve darker forces. Jonah and the few like him are fighting with help from an unlikely ally, a rogue Angel named Gabriel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the crossfire between good and evil, love and hate, and life and death, the girl learns her name: Lailah. But when the lines between black and white begin to blur, where in the spectrum will she find her place? And with whom?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel and Jonah both want to protect her. But Lailah will have to fight her own battle to find out who she truly is.&lt;/p&gt;" />
