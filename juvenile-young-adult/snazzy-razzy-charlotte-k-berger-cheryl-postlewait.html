  <title>Snazzy Razzy - Charlotte K. Berger, Cheryl Postlewait</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Snazzy Razzy is a colorful, fun and friendly little ghost who lives all alone in an old house high upon a hill with a squeaky old gate in the small Town of Shutterville. He is lonely at times because the family who lived in the old house moved away and he had no one to call his true friend. Snazzy Razzy is different than others because his coat of many colors changes with his feelings.  If he was sad, it turned indigo and violet. When he was happy, it turned bright and colorful. Having never left his home before, Snazzy Razzy decided to adventure into the big city nearby called, Busytown. There he befriends a homeless little golden butterfly, whom he names Goldie. Snazzy Razzy and the little butterfly become true friends forever and learn that true happiness must come from within. Snazzy Razzy learns that he must love and be a true friend to himself before he can be a friend to others. The moral and lesson to this enchanting childrens story is that Snazzy Razzy and Goldie realize they must accept and love themselves as they are and being different is okay. He learns that it wasnt his coat of many colors after all that made him special. Snazzy Razzy was special because he was friendly, kind and loved helping others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
