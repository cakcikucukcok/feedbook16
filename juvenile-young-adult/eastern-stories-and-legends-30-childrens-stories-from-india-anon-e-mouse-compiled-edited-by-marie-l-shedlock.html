  <title>EASTERN STORIES AND LEGENDS - 30 Childrens Stories from India - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled &amp; Edited By Marie L. Shedlock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are a collection of children&amp;rsquo;s stories from the East are a collection of Hindu and Buddhist tales, which are a marked change from our normal diet of Western folklore. In this volume you will find 30 children&amp;rsquo;s which have their roots in the life giving waters of the Brahmaputra and Ganges rivers of that magnificent range of mountains we know as the Himalayas.&lt;br /&gt;
Here you will find stories like:&lt;br /&gt;
The Banyan Deer&lt;br /&gt;
The Pupil Who Taught His Teacher&lt;br /&gt;
The Man Who Told A Lie&lt;br /&gt;
The Crow That Thought It Knew&lt;br /&gt;
The Judas Tree&lt;br /&gt;
The River-Fish And The Money; and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may be astonished to find that the ethics of these stories are identical with many of the Western standard fare: here we find condemnation of hypocrisy, cruelty, selfishness, and vice of every kind and a constant appeal to Love, Pity, Honesty, loftiness of purpose and breadth of vision.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In a time when our awareness of nature and the threats it faces is ever more present, the Indian mind never has any hesitation in acknowledging its kinship with nature, its unbroken relation with all, which is perhaps the best summing up of the value of this collection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So sit back with a steamy beverage and be prepared to be entertained for many-an-hour with this collection of &amp;ldquo;fresh&amp;rdquo; tales and stories. If and when you come to pick up the story where you left it, don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if you find a younger reader is now engrossed in the book and is reluctant to let it go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the net sale will be donated to charities by the publisher.&lt;br /&gt;
