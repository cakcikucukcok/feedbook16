  <title>Are You Thinking Again, Dear? - Aliki Brandenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Poor Charles! He&#39;s going to be late for school again. &lt;BR&gt;Charles just can&#39;t keep his mind on what he&#39;s supposed to be doing. When he is having breakfast, he is thinking about Niagara Falls. When he is in math class, he is thinking about aeronautics. When he walks down a breezy street collecting seed pods, he is thinking about a new nose. Charles is always thinking about something else.&lt;BR&gt;When his teacher, Miss Crocky, sends him to the principal&#39;s office for disrupting the class again, kind Mr. Mickle suggests that Charles be less &lt;I&gt;absent&lt;/I&gt;-minded and more &lt;I&gt;present&lt;/I&gt;-minded. Charles sits down and thinks about it. It is not that Charles is naughty. But no matter how hard he tries, his thoughts wander. Nothing seems to help. That is, until his hero, Great Uncle Croc&amp;#243;dila, pays the family a surprise visit. &lt;BR&gt;This is a new book about Charles, written and illustrated by Aliki&amp;#8212;the third in a delightful series that follows the award-winning &lt;I&gt;Keep Your Mouth Closed, Dear&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Use Your Head, Dear.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
