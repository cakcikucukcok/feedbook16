  <title>THE BROWN FAIRY BOOK - 32 Illustrated Folk and Fairy Tales - Anon E. Mouse,  Illustrated by H. J. Ford, Compiled and Edited by Andrew Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the 10th Fairy Books of Many Colours compiled and edited by Andrew Lang. The stories in all the books are borrowed from many countries &amp;ndash; Australia, North America, Southern Africa, New Caledonia located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, Persia, Northern Europe, India, South America and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However much these nations differ about trifles, they all agree in liking fairy tales. Herein you will find 32 illustrated fairy tales like What the Rose did to the Cypress, The Bunyip, The Story of the Yara, The Cunning Hare, The Turtle and his Bride, The Sacred Milk of Koumongo&amp;eacute;, The Wicked Wolverine, The Elf Maiden, Asmund and Signy and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stories are further enhanced by 8 coloured plates, 22 full-page pen and ink drawings and 21 In Text sketches by H. J. Ford.&lt;br /&gt;
This book contains many references to fairies. As to whether there are really any fairies or not, is a difficult question.&amp;nbsp; Andrew Lang never saw any himself, but he knew several people who have seen them-in the Highlands - and heard their music.&amp;nbsp; So, if ever you are near Nether Lochaber, go to the Fairy Hill, and you may hear the music your-self, but you must go on a fine day&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
