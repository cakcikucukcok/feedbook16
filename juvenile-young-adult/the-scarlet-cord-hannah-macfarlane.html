  <title>The Scarlet Cord - Hannah MacFarlane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Armed men reach the base of the hill where Jericho stands. As they do so, faces begin to appear at the windows and on the roofs, attracted by the sound of the ram&#39;s horns and fascinated by the sight of the Israelite procession. Where&#39;s the twist? What are these men planning?
From the writer of Fire By Night and the winner of SU’s fiction competition comes another story set against the background of a great Bible adventure. The Scarlet Cord is a fictional story set against the backdrop of the fall of Jericho from Joshua 2-6 and allows children to explore themes of God’s plan and their place in it, of trust in God and of God’s promises. 
Ideal for discovering the story of Joshua, through this fantastic adventure story children aged 9+ will be able to explore the story from their own viewpoint. They will investigate what it means to be part of God’s bigger plan, even though sometimes we don’t understand or don&#39;t want to do something we think is less exciting." />
