  <title>Stories for Children of All Ages - Conrad Alan Istock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most of the stories here may initially seem to be just ordinary ones for children, but they really are for children of all ages, as the book title suggests. By this, I mean that all of them have deeper ideas or meanings. Some show us how some animals can be much like humans in ways they think, communicate, or show hard work and devotion to different tasks or challenges. 
Other stories have various humans as the main characters. All through these stories, we see many kinds of challenges and difficulties we all face as humans in our modern world. In several places, stories bring in scientific information or reasoningscience fiction, if you wish. 
As one proceeds through this sequence of stories some may become more difficult depending on the actual age of the reader or listener. Simply chose the ones that are best for you and leave harder ones for another time. The last story about Apollo is quite brief." />
