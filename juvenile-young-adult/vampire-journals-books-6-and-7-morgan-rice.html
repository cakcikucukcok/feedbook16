      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A book to rival TWILIGHT and VAMPIRE DIARIES, and one that will have you wanting to keep reading until the very last page! If you are into adventure, love and vampires this book is the one for you!&quot; &lt;p&gt;--Vampirebooksite.com (regarding Turned)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The #1 Bestselling series!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bundle includes books #6 (DESTINED) and #7 (DESIRED) in Morgan Rice&#39;s #1 bestselling series THE VAMPIRE JOURNALS. These two bestselling novels, all here in one convenient file, offer a great next step in the VAMPIRE JOURNALS series. Over 100,000 words of reading, all for an incredible price! It is a great deal, and it also makes the perfect gift!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In BETROTHED (Book #6 in the Vampire Journals), Caitlin and Caleb find themselves, once again, back in time-this time, in the London of 1599. London in 1599 is a wild place, filled with paradoxes: while on the one hand it is an incredibly enlightened, sophisticated time, breeding playwrights like Shakespeare, on the other, it is also barbaric and cruel, with daily public executions, torture, and heads of prisoners impaled on spikes. It is also a time of superstition and grave public danger, with a lack of sanitation, and the Bubonic Plague spreading in the streets, carried by rats.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In VOWED (Book #7 of the Vampire Journals), Caitlin and Caleb find themselves in medieval Scotland, in 1350, a time of knights and shining armor, of castles and warriors, of the quest for the Holy Grail said to contain the key to true vampire immortality. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 12 books in THE VAMPIRE JOURNALS are now available!&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;THE VAMPIRE JOURNALS series has had a great plot..... The ending was a cliffhanger that was so spectacular that you will immediately want to buy the next book, just to see what happens.&quot;&lt;p&gt;--The Dallas Examiner, regarding Loved&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Morgan Rice has really come up with a winner in this series. It is fast paced, filled with action, love, suspense, and intrigue!&quot;&lt;p&gt;--VampireBookSite" />
