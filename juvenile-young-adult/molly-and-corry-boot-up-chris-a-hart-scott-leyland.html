  <title>Molly and Corry Boot Up! - Chris A Hart, Scott Leyland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When &lt;strong&gt;Molly, &lt;/strong&gt;a shy eleven year old, moves to a new town because of dads&amp;rsquo; promotion, she loses touch with her friends and mum considers this a problem, but Molly simply retreats to her computer and doesn&amp;#39;t see what the fuss is about; &amp;ldquo;after all&amp;rdquo; she says &amp;ldquo;if you think about it, you don&amp;#39;t choose friends they just happen,&amp;rdquo; and when dad updates her computer, a new friend &amp;ldquo;just happens&amp;rdquo;, bringing along a whole new outlook on life. &lt;strong&gt;CORVUS&lt;/strong&gt; is the world&amp;rsquo;s most advanced Artificial Intelligence and is on a mission to find out about people; Molly seems to be an ideal assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content to be anonymous in class, quiet and happily cruising on the fringes of the groups within, Molly&amp;#39;s association with Corry, (her nickname for CORVUS&amp;rsquo;), is about to catapult her into the spotlight, literally centre stage. Corry&amp;#39;s unsolicited help boosts Molly&amp;#39;s profile and shatters the&amp;nbsp;tranquillity of her crafted anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corry, the ultimate in defence technology, thinks she knows everything, but knowing isn&amp;#39;t the same as understanding; the program doesn&amp;#39;t say &amp;lsquo;Why&amp;rsquo; her protection is necessary and that&amp;#39;s frustrating. With Molly navigating ethical dilemmas and Corry discovering the concept of friendship (while denying certain responses could be emerging emotions), there are bound to be problems. Facing logical, emotional and even life threatening issues, Molly experiences different types of friendships laced with drama, chocolate and leopards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine Enid Blyton and Isaac Asimov discussing the tale of two totally different, lonely strangers&amp;nbsp;coming together. The tale of their friendship is told with warmth and humour as they&amp;nbsp;develop an understanding of the world around them. The story introduces us to the two eponymous characters and their perceived guidelines for friendship and as the adventure unfolds their mutual respect and independent personalities cement their partnership creating an enduring bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common computing concepts are discussed and although Corry is the first self aware computer entity, her abilities are kept firmly in the realms of science fact (honestly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Molly and Corry: Boot Up! The Friendship Paradox.&amp;rdquo; is written for a primary audience of&amp;nbsp;8 to 14&amp;nbsp;yr olds and is the first in&amp;nbsp;a series of Molly and Corry books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Hart, the author, has been teaching Computing for over twenty years, educating students aged from 9 to 19, slightly older Business Executives as well as their Silver Surfer parents and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book contains 12 inset illustrations by a great new artistic talent Scott Leyland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With related material for readers on their new website at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mollyandcorry.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.mollyandcorry.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
