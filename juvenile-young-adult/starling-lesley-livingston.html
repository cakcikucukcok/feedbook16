  <title>Starling - Lesley Livingston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mason Starling is a champion fencer on the Gosforth Academy team, but she&#39;s never had to fight for her life. Not until the night a ferocious, otherworldly storm rips through Manhattan, trapping Mason and her teammates inside the school. Mason is besieged by nightmarish creatures more terrifying than the thunder and lightning as the raging tempest also brings a dangerous stranger into her life: a young man who remembers nothing but his name&amp;#8212;the Fennrys Wolf. His arrival tears Mason&#39;s world apart, even as she feels an undeniable connection to him. Together, they seek to unravel the secrets of Fenn&#39;s identity as strange and supernatural forces gather around them. When they discover Mason&#39;s family&amp;#8212;with its dark allegiance to ancient Norse gods&amp;#8212;is at the heart of the mystery, Fennrys and Mason are suddenly faced with a terrifying future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set against the gritty, shadowed back-drop of New York City, this first novel in award-winning author Lesley Livingston&#39;s epic Starling Saga is an intoxicating blend of sweeping romance and pulse-pounding action.  &lt;/p&gt;" />
