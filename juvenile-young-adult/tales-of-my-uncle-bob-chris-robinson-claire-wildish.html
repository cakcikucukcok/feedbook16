  <title>Tales of My Uncle Bob - Chris Robinson, Claire Wildish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Uncle Bob is a drover, a shearer, and a hero in the Northern Australian outback. The things that he does are often difficult to believe, but where he livesin the lonely, isolated deserts of Australiaanything is possible. From the time he was discovered by cigar-smoking Mary OToole, Uncle Bob learned that being himself as well as he could be was the most important thing. He didn&#39;t need money or fame to be happy. Sometimes you realize that the richest people in the world might have no money at all. What they do have are other things inside that are all their own. These are some of his stories. I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed reading them in his letters." />
