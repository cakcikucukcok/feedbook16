  <title>Blood Heritage - Amy Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For the first twenty years of her life, Ember thought she was just your average, everyday teenage girl. Now a young adult, she has decided that its time to learn the secret of why her father abandoned her before she was even born. What she learns in the process shatters her worldand even make her question her definition of reality.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Spared from a brutal attack by an enigmatic vampire named Arystar, Ember sets out on a strange journey of self-discovery. On the night she could have lost her life, Arystar saved her for a very specific purpose. He believes ember is destined to be a great leader among vampires, one who will save the world for vampires and humans alike. In this new world, myth and legend are realitiesand Ember begins to learn that not all monsters are evil.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Tasked with the seemingly impossible challenge of bringing together the fiercely independent vampires she meets, Ember must find a way to inspire this group to cooperate for the common good. Can she find the common thread to unite a London sewer rat, a Victorian duchess, a Civil War general, a 1920s Chicago mobster, an orphaned Catholic girl, and a headstrong twentieth-century doctorlet alone the newest additions? If they have any hope of survival, they must put their past differences aside to save their future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
