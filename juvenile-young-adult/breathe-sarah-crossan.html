  <title>Breathe - Sarah Crossan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The world has no air. If you want to survive, you pay to breathe. But what if you can&#39;t? And what if you think everything could be different? Three teens will leave everything they know behind in Sarah Crossan&#39;s gripping and original dystopian teen novel of danger, longing, and glimmering hope that will appeal to fans of Patrick Ness and Veronica Roth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Book Award Finalist Kathleen Duey called &lt;em&gt;Breathe&lt;/em&gt; &quot;An amazing story! Sit down. Inhale. Now, while you still can.&quot; Ever since the Switch, when the oxygen levels plummeted and most of humanity died, the survivors have been protected in glass domes full of manufactured air. Protected . . . or trapped? Or controlled? Alina&#39;s a revolutionary who believes we can save the environment. Quinn&#39;s a Premium who&#39;s never had to worry about having enough air. His best friend, Bea, is an Auxiliary who&#39;s never worried about anything but having enough air. When the three cross paths, they will change everything. Sarah Crossan&#39;s thrilling and provocative novel is about passion, about yearning for something better, and about breaking free for the very first time. &lt;em&gt;The Bulletin of the Center for Children&#39;s Books&lt;/em&gt; proclaims it an &quot;action-packed dystopian series opener to watch out for.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
