  <title>Buzzin&#39; with Kindness - Sophia Z. Domogola, Dwight Nacayuna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story is about ten bees bullying one another while flying around in Mrs. Busys classroom. The ten bees are buzzing very loud, shouting at one another, crashing into one another, pushing, shoving, trying to sting the children, and flying around the classroom while Mrs. Busy is teaching. These are not acceptable behaviors. The bees are being rude and are trying to bully one another. All of a sudden, the bees decide being bullies is wrong. Being bullies to one another is not the correct thing to do. The bees decide to be kind, use kind language to one another, use good manners, be polite, and set a good example for the children. Being bullies set a bad example for the children. Mrs. Busy tells the children to behave nicely to one another. She tells the children they should not push, hurt, shove, or bully one another. They need to be thoughtful, kind, and say Excuse me or Im sorry. Being a bully is not the correct behavior either in school or outside of school or anywhere. Mrs. Busy tells the children to do their best in school and play together nicely as bullying hurts the feelings of others. Mrs. Busy lets the children know they should use only kind words and their indoor voices, they should be good listeners, and they should not punch, kick, shove, hit, spit, and grab one another. Bullying hurts others. The ten bees were wrong to hurt one another. No bullying! Bullying others is not an acceptable behavior. Bullying hurts!" />
