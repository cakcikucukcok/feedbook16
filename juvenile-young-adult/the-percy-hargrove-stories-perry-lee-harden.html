  <title>The Percy Hargrove Stories - Perry Lee Harden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Percy Hargrove is a bright and precocious eleven-year-old boy growing up in New York City in 1976.
The Percy Hargrove Stories is a collection of heartfelt and inspiring short stories about Percys life and growth.  Through them we travel into Percys world and witness his triumphs over hardship, calamity and misfortune.  From Percy we learn that intellect, kindness, laughter and a good dose of common sense can ultimately overcome racism, bullying, negative peer pressure and family conflicts.    He shows us how to turn the difficult circumstances of life into opportunities to display friendship, forgiveness and love.
Young Percy Hargrove is a product of the city.  He&#39;s no angel, no cherub and certainly no saint.  Hes a good-hearted, good-natured city kid who seeks adventure and, in the process, finds his way into and out of his fair share of trouble.  But through it all,  hes growing, learning and adapting.  Read his stories and join his journey to become a better son, a better friend, a better man." />
