  <title>THE LADY OF LLYN Y VAN VACH or The Lady of the Lake - A Welsh Legend - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 279&lt;br /&gt;
In this 279th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Welsh legend of&amp;quot;The LADY OF LLYN Y VAN VACH&amp;quot; or The Lady of the Lake - A Welsh Legend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not many miles from Llandovery, in the midst of glorious mountain scenery, is a lovely little lake known as Llyn-y-Fan-Fach, the scene of a very remarkable occurrence. Once upon a time a simple cowherd, eating his frugal meal by the edge of the water, observed with amazement, seated upon the calm surface of the lake, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. So great was his admiration for her that he cried out, and she, turning to him, gave a rapturous smile and silently disappeared beneath the waters.&lt;br /&gt;
The peasant was distracted, for he had fallen deeply in love with the beautiful lady. He waited until dark, but she did not appear again; but at daybreak the next morning he returned once more, and was again rewarded by the sight of his enchantress and another of her alluring smiles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Several times more he saw her and each time he besought her to be his wife, but she only smiled and disappeared, until at length one evening, just as the sun was setting, the beautiful lady appeared, and this time, instead of diving beneath the surface, she came to the shore, and, after some persuasion, consented to marry the youth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But there were some conditions to their marriage. What were they? Did they live happily ever after? Did they have children and isn&amp;rsquo;t the Lady of the Lake part of another legend? Well to find your answers, you will just have to download and read this story to find them!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
