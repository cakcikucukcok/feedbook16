      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a young girl discovers a magical ring that grants wishes, she soon learns that theres more to life than material things in this Christian childrens story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie and her family are visiting her grandparents, and she cant wait to bake cakes with her grandma and spend time with her grandpa. Its been hard since Sophies family moved away to a new town and a new school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While shopping at a department store with her grandmother, Sophie stumbles upon a beautiful ring on the floor and puts it on. She closes her eyes and wishes she was back at her grandparents house so she can show the pretty ring to her grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then something amazing happens. When Sophie opens her eyes, shes standing in her grandparents living room! She makes a wish to be back with her grandmother, and poof! Shes in the department store again. What kind of magic ring is it? Sophie tells her grandmother about what happened, and they decide they must ask Grandpa what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie realizes that the ring can grant her wishes. Now she can have everything shes ever wanted! But is that what God wants? With the help of her grandfather, Sophie is about to learn a lesson that will last her a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;" />
