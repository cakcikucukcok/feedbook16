      <meta name="description" content="This volume contains 39 stories of quests and adventures which the Knights of the Faery Queen undertake to prove their abilities and worthiness. Full of action and adventure, the quests the knights undertake are accompanied by 34 full-page colour illustrations.&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find the heroes and heroines like Britomart, Sir Artegall, the Lady Una and her lion, Florimell, Pastorella, Tristram, Sir Calepine and the Lady Serena plus many more. Each on a quest to answer a burning question or a dilemma they face which they need to overcome. Some of the stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Red-Cross Knight &amp;ndash; a women with the heart and armour of a man. And she fights like a man as well.&lt;br /&gt;
The Fortunes of Una &amp;ndash; how she faced and tamed her fear.&lt;br /&gt;
What befell at the House of Pride - and what the Red Cross Knight did to help it fall.&lt;br /&gt;
The Giant Orgoglio &amp;ndash; and how the Red Cross Knight overcame a person thrice his size.&lt;br /&gt;
The Deeds of (the young) Prince Arthur.&lt;br /&gt;
Sir Calidore and (the beautiful) Pastorella, and many more.&lt;br /&gt;
The book is a reworking of Edmund Spenser&amp;rsquo;s epic poem &amp;ldquo;Stories from the Faery Queen&amp;rdquo; into a Y.A. novel. Just like Spenser&amp;rsquo;s poem the work is an allegory of good versus evil and each of the quests or adventures portray a &amp;ldquo;fight&amp;rdquo; young people will have to face at some point in their life. Hidden within the quests, the action and adventure are the life lessons to better equip young people before they venture into the wide world of life.&lt;br /&gt;
