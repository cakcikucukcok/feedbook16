  <title>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&#39;There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school year, and they will test the champions in many different ways ... their magical prowess - their daring - their powers of deduction - and, of course, their ability to cope with danger.&#39;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Triwizard Tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to enter - but that doesn&#39;t stop Harry dreaming that he will win the competition. Then at Hallowe&#39;en, when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find his name is one of those that the magical cup picks out. He will face death-defying tasks, dragons and Dark wizards, but with the help of his best friends, Ron and Hermione, he might just make it through - alive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pottermore has now launched the Wizarding World Book Club.
