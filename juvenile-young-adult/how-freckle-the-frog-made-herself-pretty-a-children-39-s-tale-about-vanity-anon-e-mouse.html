In this 468th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the children&amp;rsquo;s story of &amp;quot;How Freckle Frog Made Herself Pretty&amp;quot; a children&amp;#39;s story about vanity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Freckle was a frog who lived under the big rock. She was ugly, as all frogs are, but she loved pretty things. One day she saw a little girl, called Marian, and she had a doll called Big Mary. Both were prettily dressed in fine clothes. Freckle would sit under her rock and watch Marian play with big Mary in the garden, and she would sigh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then Freckle decided that she too wanted to be pretty and wear fine clothes. But just where would a frog find fine clothes&amp;hellip;..?&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next? Did Freckle manage to finds fine clothes and did she manage to make herself look pretty? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It is our hope that in looking up these place names, using Google Maps, that young people will be able to see images and read about other peoples and cultures from around the world. Through this activity, it is also our hope that young people will not only increase their world geography but also increase their understanding and tolerance of other people and cultures. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Baba Indaba Children&amp;#39;s Stories, published by Abela Publishing, uses folklore and fairy tales which have their origins mists of time. Afterall who knows who wrote the original story of Cinderella, also known in other cultures as The Little Glass Slipper, or Cenerentola (Italian), Cendrillon, ou La petite Pantoufle de Verre (French), Aschenputtel (German), Tattercoats and Cap o&amp;rsquo; Rushes (English), or Conkiajgharuna (Georgian). There is still debate as to whether the story originated in ancient Egypt or China. So who wrote the original? The answer is simple. No-one knows, or will ever know, so to assume that anyone owns the rights to these stories is nothing but nonsense. Quite often we use the Author name &amp;quot;Anon E. Mouse&amp;quot; which, of course, is a play on the word &amp;quot;Anonymous&amp;quot;." />
