  <title>Belle Prater&#39;s Boy - Ruth White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Around 5:00 a.m. on a warm Sunday morning on October 1953, my Aunt Belle left her bed and vanished from the face of the earth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone in Coal Station, Virginia, has a theory about what happened to Belle Prater, but twelve-year-old Gypsy wants the facts, and when her cousin Woodrow, Aunt Belle&#39;s son moves next door, she has her chance. Woodrow isn&#39;t as forthcoming as Gypsy hopes, yet he becomes more than just a curiosity to her-- during their sixth-grade year she finds that they have enough in common to be best friends. Even so, Gypsy is puzzled by Woodrow&#39;s calm acceptance of his mother&#39;s disappearance, especially since she herself has never gotten over her father&#39;s death. When Woodrow finally reveals that he&#39;s been keeping a secret about his mother, Gypsy begins to understand that there are different ways of finding the strength to face the truth, no matter how painful it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Belle Prater&#39;s Boy&lt;/i&gt; is a 1996 Boston Globe - Horn Book Awards Honor Book for Fiction and a 1997 Newbery Honor Book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
