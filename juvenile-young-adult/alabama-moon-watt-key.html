  <title>Alabama Moon - Watt Key</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For as long as ten-year-old Moon can remember, he has lived out in the forest in a shelter with his father. They keep to themselves, their only contact with other human beings an occasional trip to the nearest general store. When Moon&#39;s father dies, Moon follows his father&#39;s last instructions: to travel to Alaska to find others like themselves. But Moon is soon caught and entangled in a world he doesn&#39;t know or understand; he&#39;s become property of the government he has been avoiding all his life. As the spirited and resourceful Moon encounters constables, jails, institutions, lawyers, true friends, and true enemies, he adapts his wilderness survival skills and learns to survive in the outside world, and even, perhaps, make his home there. This title has Common Core connections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alabama Moon&lt;/i&gt; is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
