  <title>The Boys King Arthur - N. C. Wyeth, Sidney Lanier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Boys King Arthur (1880) by the American poet Sidney Lanier is a re-working of the original Sir Thomas Malory&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;History of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book interprets existing French and English stories about these figures, with some of Malory&amp;#39;s own original material (the Gareth story). First published in 1485 by William Caxton, Le Morte d&amp;#39;Arthur is perhaps the best-known work of English-language Arthurian literature today. Many modern Arthurian writers have used Malory as their principal source, including T. H. White for his popular The Once and Future King and Tennyson for The Idylls of the King.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sidney Lanier was born in 1842, in Georgia. He was mostly of English ancestry. His distant French Huguenot ancestors immigrated to England in the 16th century fleeing religious persecution. He began playing the flute at an early age, and his love of that musical instrument continued throughout his life." />
