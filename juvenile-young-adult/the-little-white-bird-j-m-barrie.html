  <title>The Little White Bird - J. M. Barrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes the little boy who calls me father brings me an invitation from his mother: &amp;ldquo;I shall be so pleased if you will come and see me,&amp;rdquo; and I always reply in some such words as these: &amp;ldquo;Dear madam, I decline.&amp;rdquo; And if David asks why I decline, I explain that it is because I have no desire to meet the woman. &amp;ldquo;Come this time, father,&amp;rdquo; he urged lately, &amp;ldquo;for it is her birthday, and she is twenty-six,&amp;rdquo; which is so great an age to David, that I think he fears she cannot last much longer. &amp;ldquo;Twenty-six, is she, David?&amp;rdquo; I replied. &amp;ldquo;Tell her I said she looks more.&amp;rdquo; I had my delicious dream that night. I dreamt that I too was twenty-six, which was a long time ago, and that I took train to a place called my home, whose whereabouts I see not in my waking hours, and when I alighted at the station a dear lost love was waiting for me, and we went away together. She met me in no ecstasy of emotion, nor was I surprised to find her there; it was as if we had been married for years and parted for a day. I like to think that I gave her some of the things to carry." />
