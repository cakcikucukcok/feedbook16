  <title>Love Scene, Take Two - Alex Evansley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debut author Alex Evansley delivers a sweet summer romance in this inventive novel about a young heartthrob and teen author falling in love. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teddy Sharpe is kind of famous. He might actually be on his way to being really famous, especially if he&#39;d nailed an audition for the lead role in the movie adaption of the newest bestselling young adult book series. There&#39;s just one problem: He totally blew the audition. And he&#39;s stuck in a tiny North Carolina airport. And his maybe-ex-girlfriend kind of just broke up with him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weekend isn&#39;t exactly looking good until Bennett Caldwell, author of the very book series he just auditioned for, takes pity on him and invites him to her family&#39;s lake house. Away from the glitz and glam of Hollywood for a few days, Teddy starts to relax . . . and somehow he and Bennett just click. But dating is hard enough when you aren&#39;t the subject of several dozen fanblogs, and the Internet is full of juicy gossip about Teddy and Bennett . . . gossip that Bennett might not be prepared to handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chosen by readers like you for Macmillan&#39;s young adult imprint Swoon Reads, Alex Evansley&#39;s debut novel, written from both Bennett and Teddy&#39;s perspectives, will have teens laughing, swooning, and falling in love along with these fantastically relatable characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Love Scene, Take Two:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A &lt;b&gt;modern, cool, lovable story&lt;/b&gt; that easily makes you swoon.&quot; --SofiaTypes, reader on SwoonReads.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;This story had me laughing and crying.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; --Basicgrill, reader on SwoonReads.com&lt;/p&gt;" />
