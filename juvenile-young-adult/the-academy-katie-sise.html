All she needs to do is get into the elite American Fashion Academy in New York City. If she gets in, her life plans will be going right on schedule.

How is Frankie, the least athletic person in the world, who knows absolutely nothing about the military, going to survive a whole semester at the famed&amp;#8212;and feared&amp;#8212;Academy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With classmates who seem to be totally uninterested in her, a course load that&amp;#8217;s even more difficult than her old school&amp;#8217;s, and the weird War Games competition she has to join, Frankie finds that her life is way tougher than it used to be. And no one, including her roommate Joni, seems to understand Frankie at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she learns how to cope with impossible military drills and intimidating specialized classes and is maybe even falling for super-hot and super-smart cadet Jack Wattson, can Frankie prove to everyone that being a fashionista doesn&amp;#8217;t mean she can&amp;#8217;t succeed? &lt;/p&gt;" />
