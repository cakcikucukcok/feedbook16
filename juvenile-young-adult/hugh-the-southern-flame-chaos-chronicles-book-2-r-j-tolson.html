  <title>Hugh The Southern Flame (Chaos Chronicles Book 2) - R. J. Tolson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Centuries past, the world of Evos fell into war as its inhabitants battled over the powerful Nios Crystal, said to allow its user to control fear itself. After the crystal was lost and worldwide destruction blanketed the land, a band of survivors founded six great cities across the globe, never leaving their dream of global domination behind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, Burst, the only technologically advanced city of the great six, produces and studies superhuman students with powers, known as Espers. Competing for the ultimate treasure, as well as global dominance, special students are recruited into the Agency to become Burst agents-famed and powerful elite members of society who are sent around the world on missions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the son of a disgraced and exiled legendary agent, seventeen-year-old Hugh has always wanted to join the Agency to redeem the honor of his family name-problem is, even though he is an Esper, Hugh has been classified a level one, barely passable as having supernatural powers. But all of that changes after he becomes an agent candidate, the beginning of a series of events that reveals the truth not only of the chaotic world around him and the shadowy figures at work, but of the destiny that awaits him.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On a quest full of endless adventure and suspense, Hugh must journey through the beast-filled wastelands, hone his powers, and find the Nios Crystal-or let everything around him perish as the entire world drowns in fear and darkness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
