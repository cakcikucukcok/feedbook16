  <title>THE JIPI - An Old Romanian Children&#39;s Story - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 263&lt;br /&gt;
In this 263rd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Romanian story of &amp;ldquo;THE JIPI&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
In far away, old Roumania, there is a range of mountains named the Bucegi-group. Among these the two peaks of Jipi tower aloft, close together, as though gazing defiantly at one another, and between them the Urlatoare, or &amp;ldquo;roaring stream,&amp;rdquo; dashes down a narrow channel and plummets in a cloud-like waterfall, into the valley below, and storms onward over every barrier towards the town of Prahova.&lt;br /&gt;
It is said that long, long ago the Jipi were twin-brothers, who loved each other so well that one could not live without the other, or eat a mouthful of bread the other did not share; nay, more&amp;mdash;that when one was asked a question, the other answered it, and that when one did himself some hurt, the other wept and would not be comforted. They were as fair as morning and evening, as slender and straight as lances, as swift as arrows, as strong as young bears.&lt;br /&gt;
Some even exclaimed &amp;ldquo;You are double! Like two hazel-nuts in one shell,&amp;rdquo; and they weren&amp;rsquo;t wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
The mother who had borne them looked upon them with pride and joy, and would say, as she stroked their curly heads, &amp;ldquo;Andrei and Mirea, my beautiful sons, may your fame become so great that even the stones shall discourse of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
One day while hunting in the woods, they meet the beautiful Rolanda, whose is called Urlanda for her wild ways and equally wild dark, black locks which flow down and over her shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;
Both boys fall in love with this bewitching beauty. But there can only be one suitor, and is all what it seems to be or is there a darker and more sinister reason for Rolanda suddenly arriving on the scene?&lt;br /&gt;
Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to download and read the story to find out, wont you!&lt;br /&gt;

Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
