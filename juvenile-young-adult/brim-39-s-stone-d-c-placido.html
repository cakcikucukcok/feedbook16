To become a Newolde Ligdom Knight, so he can rid his world of Dragons once and for all. He has worked very hard to achieve that dream, for the last eight years he has excelled in all disciplines of the Junior Knights, collecting each piece of armor along the way. Finally, he has turned thirteen, now he can take his final exams and earn the last badge of honor, a real sword. But Widgett, Tallen&amp;rsquo;s guardian, thinks Tallen has hidden talents that are better suited for other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one of the most celebrated days of the year, a familiar stranger visits the kingdom and changes the course of Tallen&amp;rsquo;s path drastically, but Widgett has a plan. Widgett always has a plan. This plan takes Widgett and Tallen, who are joined by Misty Rose, Newolde Ligdom&amp;rsquo;s greatest archer who also just happens to be a princess, beyond the forbidden waterfall, where they find an unexpected companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misty Rose and the new companion join Tallen on a journey that he never expected to take. A journey where forgiveness is the first step and Tallen must quickly learn there is more to him than he ever dreamt possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
