  <title>Megan&#39;s Phone Call - Denise Sullivan Bernes, Megan Barnes, Christine Hoecker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Does God hear prayers?  Helping children understand that God hears their prayers can be a challenging task because God is not visible.  In Megans Phone Call, you and your child will go on a journey with Megan and her mother where they come to realize the importance of conversation with God through prayer.  Follow Megan as she discovers that prayer is as simple as talking to a friend on the phone. Along the way, she gains confidence that God hears her, and she learns that conversations with God--just like conversations with friends--are essential and rewarding.  At the end of their journey, you and your child will be invited to pray with Megan and her mother, while also being encouraged to continue praying each day. God longs to have conversation with each of us, and yes, God does hear and answer all prayers." />
