  <title>THE WONDERFUL BASKET - An American Indian Children’s Story - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 201&lt;br /&gt;
In this 201st issue of the Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories series, Baba Indaba narrates the American-Indian, Tlingit, tale of &amp;ldquo;THE WONDERFUL BASKET.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
In the North-Western USA, crops had failed and the Tlingit tribe was experiencing hard times. The clan elders had imposed food rationing and people were going hungry. One day two sisters, belonging to one of the noblest families, took some food out of the food box.&lt;br /&gt;
Not happy about being scolded and disciplined, the girls creep away during the night and head into the mountains. Wandering aimlessly they barely survive on a diet of berries and are just about to give up when they hear someone chopping wood. They follow the sound and come across a man chopping up a tree. Seeing their hunger he invites them back to his home and feeds them.&lt;br /&gt;
The next day he says he has a long journey but will return in a day or so. He warns them not to cross the river, for an evil woman lives there and all who cast eyes upon her are never seen alive again.&lt;br /&gt;
But do the sisters listen? You&amp;rsquo;re invited to download and read the story of the two sisters and the Mountain Man and how the wonderful basket fits into the story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
