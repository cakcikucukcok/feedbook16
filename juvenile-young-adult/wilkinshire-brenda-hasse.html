  <title>Wilkinshire - Brenda Hasse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Though few in the medieval kingdom of Wilkinshire have seen the legendary dragon known as Bogotah, many fear him. Stories passed down for  generations tell of his capability to breathe fire, spread deadly disease, and  consume livestock and people to appease his insatiable appetite. Even so, Bogotah upholds his duty to guard the kingdom and his treasured secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the assassination of their lord, the residents of Wilkinshire line the  muddy street to meet their new rulers. Appointed to reconstruct the battered kingdom, Lord Philip and his wife, Lady Rachelle, are in disbelief at the magnitude of their undertaking as poverty-stricken citizens greet them with rotted teeth, filthy clothing, and pathetic living conditions. As the lord and lady settle into their new residence, Lord Philip is confronted with the peasants belief that Bogotah is to blame for Wilkinshires misfortunes. In order to put the citizens superstitions to rest, he must discover who is responsible for the kingdoms bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Lord Thaddeus of Lancaster, an evil soul consumed by greed, waits for the opportune moment to claim Wilkinshire for himself. Spurred on by a voracious desire to obtain the legendary Treasure of Wilkinshire, he will stop at nothing to obtain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only time will reveal the fate of the kingdom and of the spectacular treasure hidden somewhere within its walls.&lt;/p&gt;" />
