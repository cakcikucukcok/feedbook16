  <title>WHAT THE MOON SAW AND OTHER TALES - 45 stories from the pen of H C Andersen - Hans Christian Andersen, Illustrated by A. W. Bayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume was intended as a sequel to Andersen&amp;rsquo;s 1864 &lt;i&gt;Stories and Tales&lt;/i&gt; (see end pages of this book) and was aimed at slightly older children. This book of fairy tales and stories deals with more complex moral questions, without sacrificing Andersen&amp;rsquo;s characteristic imaginative and fantasy elements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The series of sketches of varying lengths in this book arose from the Andersen&amp;rsquo;s experiences when as a youth he went to seek his fortune Copenhagen, in the capital of his native land; and the story entitled &amp;quot;Under the Willow Tree&amp;quot; is said likewise to have its foundation in fact.&lt;br /&gt;
Containing 45 stories and tales, it is Illustrated with 80 woodcuts done by the brothers Dalziel, from illustrations by Alfred Water Bayes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
What the Moon Saw&lt;br /&gt;
The Story of the Year&lt;br /&gt;
The Goblin and the Huckster&lt;br /&gt;
In a Thousand Years&lt;br /&gt;
The Bond of Friendship&lt;br /&gt;
Jack the Dullard&lt;br /&gt;
Under the Willow Tree&lt;br /&gt;
The Beetle&lt;br /&gt;
A Leaf from the Sky&lt;br /&gt;
The Dumb Book plus many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, we invite you to download this ebook, find a comfy chair and settle in to be entertained for hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;
