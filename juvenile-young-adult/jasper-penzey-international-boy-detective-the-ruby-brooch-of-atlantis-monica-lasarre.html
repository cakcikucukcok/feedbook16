  <title>Jasper Penzey: International Boy Detective: The Ruby Brooch of Atlantis - Monica LaSarre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jasper Penzey has never known his mother and his father never wants to speak of her. At the ripe age of 9 years old, on the eve of his and his father&#39;s move from Louisiana to Santorini, Greece, precocious Jasper discovers an amulet and a note from his mother. So begins the journey of a lifetime into island life, complete with a traipse through history and a search for the location of the lost city of Atlantis. What starts out as a summer of fun tagging along with his history professor father, quickly turns into a romp through all things Greek with a host of new friends and an undercurrent which pulls Jasper into searching for his mother.  At his side throughout his search for Atlantis is his new friend Cally. Together they learn that dodging men who are following you can be scary; that ice cream is a perfect pawn for negotiating with those who stand in your way; and how to trust in the help of friends and family. Jasper discovers how heart-wrenching it can be to leave behind the only home he has ever known and how to make friends in a new place where everything seems foreign. He also learns that the love of a mother can come from unlikely sources, a blessedly welcome fact for a boy who is grievously missing his own. www.monicalasarre" />
