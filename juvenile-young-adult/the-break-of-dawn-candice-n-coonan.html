  <title>The Break of Dawn - Candice N. Coonan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Time is marching on and a new light is arising...
&lt;p&gt;
The Queen of Algernon faces her toughest challenge yet, when an unknown enemy from the past comes seeking vengeance. Decisions the Queen has made come back to haunt her, as a certain Denzelian sorceress casts a Dark Dream over everyone. What is Queen Alice willing to give to save those she loves?
&lt;p&gt;
Enter a new source of light. The Princess of Algernon is learning that not all adventures are fun and nothing in her life is simple anymore. If she is to survive, she must find and use her own mystic powers-not rely on those of her mother.
&lt;p&gt;
Teamed up with the Princess is a half-fairy lad, an aspiring bard and a young shepherd with a dark past. But in this world of complex motives and emotions, can they fight off their own demons within?
&lt;p&gt;
Before his shattering in a battle nearly 15 years earlier, the demon, Ralston Radburn, once said that evil cannot die because of the darkness in everyone&#39;s hearts. Could he possibly be right? Everyone is about to find out.
