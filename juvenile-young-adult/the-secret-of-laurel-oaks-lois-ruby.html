  <title>The Secret of Laurel Oaks - Lois Ruby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A haunting historical mystery based on real life events, told in the alternating points of view of a contemporary girl and a 19th century slave accused of a horrible crime. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lila and her family visit Laurel Oaks Plantation in Louisiana, her parents and brother scoff at the claim that the house is haunted. But secretly, Lila suspects there are ghostly presences willing to communicate with her, and her alone. One spirit eager to tell her story is Daphne, a slave girl at Laurel Oaks in the 1840s, who was blamed for the poisoning deaths of two girls and their mother. Daphne&#39;s spirit senses that Lila is the very person she&#39;s been waiting for, the one who can prove her innocence so her spirit can rest at long last. Shifting back and forth from Lila&#39;s world in the present to Daphne&#39;s world in the past, the true story of what really happened that fateful night finally comes to light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurel Oaks is a thinly disguised version of the legendary Myrtles Plantation in Louisiana, which is on the Smithsonian&#39;s list of the ten most haunted places in America. This middle grade novel was inspired by the author&#39;s visit to the plantation and her experiences there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
