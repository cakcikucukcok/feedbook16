  <title>Amazing Annabelle-Thank You, Veterans! - Linda Taylor, Kyle Horne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amazing Annabelle Learns&amp;nbsp;Sensitivity&amp;nbsp;toward Others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a Social Studies activity, Annabelle Copeland is paired with fellow student, Victoria, who&amp;rsquo;s a little boastful and conceited. Annabelle takes the lead in the activity and moves the group toward completing their plans to honor the veterans in their town.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, Annabelle attends two drama classes with Victoria and begins to see an unpleasant side of Victoria when she makes inappropriate comments. Can Annabelle help her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they go on a field trip to interview some retired veterans, the students give them special cards, which they had made. Because she was paired with Victoria on the trip, Annabelle learns an important fact about her. Can Annabelle help her learn to deal with it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the entire class joins together in a special day of celebration for the veterans, thanking them for their service. And Annabelle learns that she shouldn&amp;rsquo;t judge others who may be struggling with difficulties from their past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linda Taylor has been teaching students for over 25 years. She enjoys connecting with students on many levels. She also loves writing poetry. Linda lives on Long Island, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle Horne has a B.A. in Visual Communications from S.U.N.Y. Old Westbury College in New York. Kyle has displayed his artwork in many local libraries.
