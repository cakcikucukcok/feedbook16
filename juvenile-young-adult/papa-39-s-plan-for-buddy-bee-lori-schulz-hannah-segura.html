  <title>Papa&#39;s Plan for Buddy Bee - Lori Schulz, Hannah Segura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Buddy Bee knows his smart, soccer-star brother, Billy, and his popular sister, Bonnie, can make a difference in their garden world, but with his crooked stinger, what could Buddy ever do? Could Papa Bee really have a good plan for him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Buddy believes the secret to flying, he can&#39;t wait to share it with his friends at school. Flying is the best thing ever! Buddy travels with Papa Bee on a delightful journey that takes him from his own beehive home into the whole big garden. He also learns about the heart of God and discovers that he truly does have special talents and gifts that he can use to make a difference in his world. Your child will learn right along with Buddy as he realizes his own important, exciting adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddy Bee will encourage your child to see his or her own God-given talents, abilities, and gifts. Your child will gain a desire to know God and to be a part of something bigto be a part of the adventure that God has planned specifically for him or her right now and in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Papa&#39;s Plan for Buddy Bee&lt;/em&gt; is a great way to share with children the need to communicate the good news to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I ran this story through the ultimate test  a private reading to my grandchildren. They not only loved the story, they caught on to the truths communicated about sharing the good news with others. It seems a much better method than simply telling them to share the good news!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
