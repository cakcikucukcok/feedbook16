  <title>The Miseducation of Cameron Post - emily m. danforth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;#160;acclaimed book behind&amp;#160;the 2018 Sundance Grand Jury Prize-winning movie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;LGBTQ cinema is out in force at Sundance Film Festival,&quot; proclaimed &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;The acerbic coming-of-age movie&amp;#160;is adapted from Emily M. Danforth&#39;s novel, and stars&amp;#160;Chlo&amp;#235; Grace Moretz as a lesbian teen who is sent to a gay conversion therapy center after she gets caught having sex with her friend on prom night.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Miseducation of Cameron Post&lt;/em&gt; is a stunning and provocative literary debut that was named to numerous best of the year&amp;#160;lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Cameron Post&amp;#8217;s parents die suddenly in a car crash, her shocking first thought is relief. Relief they&amp;#8217;ll never know that, hours earlier, she had been kissing a girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that relief doesn&amp;#8217;t last, and Cam is forced to move in with her conservative aunt Ruth and her well-intentioned but hopelessly old-fashioned grandmother. She knows that from this point on, her life will forever be different. Survival in Miles City, Montana, means blending in and leaving well enough alone, and Cam becomes an expert at both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Coley Talor moves to town. Beautiful, pickup-driving Coley is a perfect cowgirl with the perfect boyfriend to match. She and Cam forge an unexpected and intense friendship, one that seems to leave room for something more to emerge. But just as that starts to seem like a real possibility, Aunt Ruth takes drastic action to &amp;#8220;fix&amp;#8221; her niece, bringing Cam face-to-face with the cost of denying her true self&amp;#8212;even if she&amp;#8217;s not quite sure who that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t miss this raw and powerful own voices debut, the basis for the award-winning film starring Chlo&amp;#235;&amp;#160;Grace Moretz.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
