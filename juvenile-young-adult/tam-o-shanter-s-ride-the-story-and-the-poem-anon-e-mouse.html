  <title>TAM O’ SHANTER’S RIDE - The Story and the Poem - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 303&lt;br /&gt;
In this 303rd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the story of &amp;ldquo;TAM O&amp;rsquo; SHANTER&amp;rsquo;S RIDE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;. This story goes thus&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One day, many, many years ago it was market-day in Ayr, Scotland. The farmers had come into town from all the country round about, to sell or exchange their farm produce, and buy what they needed to take home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amongst these farmers was a man by the name of Tam o&amp;#39; Shanter; a good natured, happy-go-lucky sort of person, but, I am sorry to say, he enjoyed his tipple a bit too much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now Tam&amp;#39;s wife, Kate, was a grievous scold; always nagging and faultfinding, and I fear making it far easier for Tam to do wrong than if she had treated him more kindly. Because of this, Tam was happier away from home; and this day had escaped his wife&amp;#39;s scolding tongue, mounted his good gray mare Meg, and galloped off as fast as he could go to Market.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tam finished his buying and trading by lunchtime and he called in on his friends in the tavern, to share a meal and &amp;quot;Whet his Whistle&amp;quot;. Well after the sun had set and the moon was high in the sky, the publican called &amp;ldquo;Time Gentleman Please&amp;rdquo; Tam sauntered out of the pub, maybe that should be, wobbled out of the pub and after a while managed to find his mare, Meg. Then with great difficulty he mounted her and pointed her South out of the town towards home. And that&amp;rsquo;s when all the trouble started&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What sort of trouble you ask? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read the story to find out for yourselves. Needless to say the story of Tam&amp;rsquo;s troubles was spread all over the county and talked about for years so that it became a well-known legend. Many years after Tam ride, a famous Scottish Poet, Robert Burns, wrote a now famous poem about &amp;ldquo;Tam O&amp;rsquo; Shanter&amp;rsquo;s Ride&amp;rdquo; which is also included in this little book.&lt;br /&gt;

Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
