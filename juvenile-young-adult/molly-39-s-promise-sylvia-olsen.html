  <title>Molly&#39;s Promise - Sylvia Olsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Molly learns a talent competition is coming to town, her friend Murphy (&lt;i&gt;A Different Game, Murphy and Mousetrap&lt;/i&gt;) becomes her manager. Molly is certain she is a good singer—she has been singing in her head for as long as she can remember. She doesn&#39;t sing out loud because of a promise she made to herself. Years ago, Molly vowed that her mom would be the first one to hear her sing. The only problem is, Molly knows nothing about her mom, who left when Molly was a baby. With the talent competition only weeks away, she has to decide whether to break her promise to herself and let her voice out into the world, or wait for her mother&#39;s uncertain return before singing for anyone else." />
