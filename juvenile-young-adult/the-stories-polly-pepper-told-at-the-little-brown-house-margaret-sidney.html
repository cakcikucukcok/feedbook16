  <title>THE STORIES POLLY PEPPER TOLD - at the Little Brown House - Margaret Sidney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Times are tough in and around the Little Brown House! The widowed Mrs. Pepper has to sew all day long just to earn enough to pay the rent and to feed the five growing Peppers. But she faces poverty and trouble with a stout heart, a smiling face, and the help of her jolly brood: blue-eyed Ben, the eldest and the man of the house at the age of 11; pretty Polly, so eager to cook for the family and make everyone happy and comfortable; and the three littlest Peppers, Joel, Davie, and baby Phronsie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Pepper family would soon become beloved by readers all over America. Young people avidly followed the adventures of Ben, Polly, Joel, Davie, and Phronsie. While faced with many plausible trials and obstacles they remain eternally optimistic in the face of adversity, and reflect the real life issues of so many of their readers. Their universally appealing wholesome values and lives are not burdened with a heavy moralising tone which was present in many other popular works of the day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A favorite of children, parents, and teachers for generations, this heartwarming classic first appeared in 1880. Since then, it has inspired countless young imaginations with its tender tales of the ways in which courage and good cheer can overcome adversity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;
====================&lt;br /&gt;
MARGARET SIDNEY is the pen name of Harriet Mulford Stone Lothrop (June 22, 1844 &amp;ndash; August 2, 1924). At the age of 34, she began sending short stories to Wide Awake, a children&amp;#39;s magazine in Boston. Two of her stories, &amp;quot;Polly Pepper&amp;#39;s Chicken Pie&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Phronsie Pepper&amp;#39;s New Shoes&amp;quot;, proved to be very popular with readers. Ella Farman, the editor of the magazine, requested that Stone write more.&lt;br /&gt;
The success of Harriett&amp;#39;s short stories prompted her to write Five Little Peppers and its 11 sequels. The original novel was first published in 1881, the year that Stone married Daniel Lothrop. Daniel had founded the D. Lothrop Company of Boston, who published Harriett&amp;#39;s books under her pseudonym, Margaret Sidney.&lt;br /&gt;
Harriett and Daniel may have both had an interest in history and in famous authors. In 1883, they purchased the house in which both Louisa May Alcott and Nathaniel Hawthorne had lived. Nicknamed The Wayside, the house is located in Concord, Massachusetts. The year after Harriett and Daniel moved into the house, Harriett gave birth to their daughter, Margaret, at the age of 40.&lt;br /&gt;
