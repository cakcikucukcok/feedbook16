  <title>The Fourth Stall - Chris Rylander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The humor of &lt;em&gt;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&lt;/em&gt; meets a &lt;em&gt;Godfather&lt;/em&gt;-like tale of crime and betrayal in this first book in Chris Rylander&#39;s The Fourth Stall Saga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you need something? Mac can get it for you. He and his best friend and business manager, Vince. Their methods might sometimes run afoul of the law, or at least the school code of conduct, but if you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can pay him, Mac is on your side. His office is located in the East Wing boy&#39;s bathroom, fourth stall from the high window. And business is booming. Or at least it was, until this particular Monday. Because this Monday is when Mac and Vince find out that the trouble with solving everyone else&#39;s problems is there&#39;s no one left to solve yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school setting; fast-paced, cinematic, and funny story; and engaging voice make &lt;em&gt;The Fourth Stall&lt;/em&gt; a perfect classroom read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supports the Common Core State Standards&lt;/p&gt;" />
