  <title>The Book of Tea the Illustrated Classic Edition - Okakura Kakuzo, Liza Dalby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Now available in a gorgeous hardcover slipcase edition, this &quot;object d&#39;art&quot; will be sure to add grace and elegance to tea shelves, coffee tables and bookshelves.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In 1906 in turn-of-the century Boston, a small, esoteric book about tea was written with the intention of being read aloud in the famous salon of Isabella Gardner, Boston&#39;s most famous socialite. It was authored by Okakura Kakuzo, a Japanese philosopher, art expert, and curator. Little known at the time, Kakuzo would emerge as one of the great thinkers of the early 20th century, a genius who was insightful, witty&amp;#151;and greatly responsible for bridging Western and Eastern cultures.  Okakura had been taught at a young age to speak English and was more than capable of expressing to Westerners the nuances of tea and the Japanese Tea Ceremony.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;The Book of Tea Classic Edition&lt;/I&gt; he discusses such topics as Zen and Taoism, but also the secular aspects of tea and Japanese life.  A keepsake enjoyed by tea lovers for over a hundred years, it will enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the seemingly simple act of making and drinking tea.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
