  <title>Immigration, Emigration, and Migration: NOMOS LVII - Jack Knight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Questions of immigration and border enforcement practices are particularly salient in contemporary public discourse, and examinations of policy and practice bring forth new philosophical quandaries. Why the common assumption that each country has the right to control its own borders? How are laws that restrict or regulate migration created and justified? Why has the criminalization of migration increased? How can migration be better considered through the point of view of the migrants themselves? What are the differences in international and national institutional migratory policy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Immigration, Emigration and Migration&lt;/em&gt; consists of essays written by distinguished scholars across the fields of law, political science, and philosophy that examine questions of travel and migration across national borders. The volume explores questions of border control and enforcement, criminalization of borders, and how to address current debates and changes in regards to migration and immigration. The intersection of analysis and prescription provides both an assessment of current forms of thought or regulation and suggestion of alterations to address the flaws or failures of present approaches. The eight essays in this volume reflect a variety of considerations and explorations across interdisciplinary lines, and provide a new and thought-provoking discussion of policy, practice, and philosophy of migratory and border practices.&amp;nbsp;" />
