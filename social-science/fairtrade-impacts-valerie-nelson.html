  <title>Fairtrade Impacts - Valerie Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fairtrade goods are claimed to empower producers, and promote sustainable livelihoods, and it is these claims that attract consumers who willingly pay a premium for the sake of the benefits that they expect will be experienced by smallholders in developing countries. But what is the evidence for these improved impacts? How are these benefits measured, and what would be realistic expectations of the degree to which Fairtrade and other sustainability standards can tackle rural poverty in developing countries? Does Fairtrade exclude some groups or geographical regions? Do we know that benefits to smallholders reach their hired labourers? How can Fairtrade and other sustainability standards learn from empirical impact studies to reflect upon their theories of change and improve their impact?
Exploring the impacts of Fairtrade presents a series of rich, detailed case studies from the field distilling insights and lessons about the contribution of Fairtrade and sustainability standards to different social groups in particular geographies. The book seeks to contribute to the lively debate on the impact of such schemes by showing the diverse outcomes and impacts that such schemes have as they are adopted or implemented in different geographical production and value chain contexts around the world. The different cases show the many limitations of such schemes, but also discuss potential strategies for improvement. 
This book is essential reading for all those interested in value chain development, fair and ethical trade, and sustainability standards, including researchers, students, policy makers, companies and those working for development agencies." />
