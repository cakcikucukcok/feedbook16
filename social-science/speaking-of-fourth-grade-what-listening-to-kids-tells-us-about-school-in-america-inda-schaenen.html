  <title>Speaking of Fourth Grade: What Listening to Kids Tells Us About School in America - Inda Schaenen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Fourth grade is ground zero in the fierce debates about education reform in America. It&amp;#8217;s when kids (well, some of them) make the shift from &amp;#147;learning to read&amp;#8221; to &amp;#147;reading to learn,&amp;#8221; and tomes have been written about the fourth-grade year by educators, administrators, philosophers, and pundits. Now, in a fascinating and groundbreaking book, Inda Schaenen adds the voices of actual fourth-grade kids to the conversation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Schaenen, a journalist turned educator, spent a year traveling across the state of Missouri, the geographical and spiritual center of the country, visiting fourth-grade classrooms of every description: public, private, urban, rural, religious, charter. &lt;I&gt;Speaking of Fourth Grade&lt;/I&gt; looks at how our different approaches to education stack up against one another and chronicles what kids at the heart of our great, democratic education experiment have to say about &amp;#147;What Makes a Good Teacher&amp;#8221; and &amp;#147;What Makes a Good Student,&amp;#8221; as well as what they think about the Accelerated Reader programs that dominate public school classrooms, high-stakes testing, and the very purpose of school in the first place.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A brilliant and original work at the intersection of oral history, sociology, and journalism, &lt;I&gt;Speaking of Fourth Grade&lt;/I&gt; offers unique insight into the personal consequences of national education policy. The voices of the children in &lt;I&gt;Speaking of Fourth Grade&lt;/I&gt; will stay with readers&amp;#151;parents, teachers, and others&amp;#151;for many years to come.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
