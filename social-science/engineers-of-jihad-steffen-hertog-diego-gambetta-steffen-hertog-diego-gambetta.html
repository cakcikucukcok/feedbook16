  <title>Engineers of Jihad - Steffen Hertog, Diego Gambetta, Steffen Hertog, Diego Gambetta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The violent actions of a few extremists can alter the course of history, yet there persists a yawning gap between the potential impact of these individuals and what we understand about them. In &lt;i&gt;Engineers of Jihad&lt;/i&gt;, Diego Gambetta and Steffen Hertog uncover two unexpected facts, which they imaginatively leverage to narrow that gap: they find that a disproportionate share of Islamist radicals come from an engineering background, and that Islamist and right-wing extremism have more in common than either does with left-wing extremism, in which engineers are absent while social scientists and humanities students are prominent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching for an explanation, they tackle four general questions about extremism: Under which socioeconomic conditions do people join extremist groups? Does the profile of extremists reflect how they self-select into extremism or how groups recruit them? Does ideology matter in sorting who joins which group? Lastly, is there a mindset susceptible to certain types of extremism? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using rigorous methods and several new datasets, they explain the link between educational discipline and type of radicalism by looking at two key factors: the social mobility (or lack thereof) for engineers in the Muslim world, and a particular mindset seeking order and hierarchy that is found more frequently among engineers. Engineers&#39; presence in some extremist groups and not others, the authors argue, is a proxy for individual traits that may account for the much larger question of selective recruitment to radical activism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening up markedly new perspectives on the motivations of political violence, &lt;i&gt;Engineers of Jihad&lt;/i&gt; yields unexpected answers about the nature and emergence of extremism.&lt;/p&gt;" />
