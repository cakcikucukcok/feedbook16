  <title>The Art of Leading Collectively: Co-Creating a Sustainable, Socially Just Future - Petra Kuenkel, Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A guide to collaborative impact for leaders in industry, government, and social change networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our world is facing unsustainable global trends-from climate change and water scarcity to energy insecurity, unfair labor practices, and growing inequality.  Tackling these crises effectively requires a new form of leadership-a collective one.  But, in a world of many silos, how do we get people to work together toward a common goal? That is one of the most important questions facing sustainability and social-change professionals around the world, and it is a question that Petra Kuenkel answers in &lt;em&gt;The Art of Leading Collectively&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Readers learn how to tackle system change for sustainable development, reimagine leadership as a collaborative endeavor, retrain leaders to work collectively, and manage diverse groups through a change process that has sustainability as a guiding focus. Drawing upon two decades of pioneering, internationally recognized work orchestrating multi-stakeholder initiatives, Kuenkel presents her chief tool, the Collective Leadership Compass, and shows others how to use it with large groups of diverse stakeholders to solve complex, urgent problems-particularly those that enmesh business activities, governance, human needs, and environmental impacts.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  The book offers many examples of collective leadership efforts involving corporate, public, and nonprofit sectors around the world. Readers learn about the processes that led to a sustainable textile alliance and set standards for sustainable cocoa and coffee production and trade, as well as those that helped nations rebound from war, develop sustainable infrastructure, and tackle resource conflicts with global businesses, to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Kuenkel provides a clear roadmap for leaders from multinational companies involved in partnerships, international organizations engaged in cooperative development, public agencies, and interest groups-as well as for citizens seeking solutions to social and sustainability challenge&lt;/p&gt;" />
