  <title>The Impeachment of Chief Justice David Brock - John Cerullo, David C. Steelman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span style=&quot;populist&amp;rdquo; civic culture that had long assumed the primacy of the legislative branch, extolled its &amp;ldquo;citizen legislators&amp;rdquo; over insulated and professionalized elites, and entrusted those legislators to properly supervise the judiciary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.079167&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the last few decades of the 20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Century, New Hampshire&amp;rsquo;s judiciary had been substantially reconfigured: constitutional amendments and other measures endorsed by the national judicial-modernization movement had secured for it a much higher level of independence and internal unification than it had historically enjoyed. However, a bipartisan body of legislators remained committed to the principle of legislative supremacy inscribed in the state constitution of 1784. The 1980s and 1990s witnessed a series of clashes over court administration, allegations of judicial corruption, and finally a bitter and protracted battle over Court decisions on educational funding. Chief Justice Brock publicly embodied the judicial branch&amp;#39;s new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;status and assertiveness. When information came to light regarding some of his administrative actions on the high court, deepening antipathy toward him exploded into an impeachment crisis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;s conduct raised significant questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;about the meaning and proper practice of impeachment itself as a feature of democratic governance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When articles of impeachment were voted by the House of Representatives, the state Senate faced the difficult task of establishing trial protocols that would balance the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;political and juridical responsibilities devolved on them, simultaneously, by the state constitution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Having struck that balance, the trial they conducted would finally acquit Brock of all charges. Nevertheless, David Brock&amp;rsquo;s impeachment was a highly consequential ordeal that provided a needed catalyst for reforms intended to produce a productive recalibration of legislative-judicial relations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
