  <title>China and the World - Ben Mah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ben Mahs book is an excellent warning of the problems  indeed, economic depth charges  that were planted in  China by the neoliberals who have destroyed nearly every economy where their advice was followed. Ben Mahs &lt;i&gt;China and the World&lt;/i&gt; describes what China should accept and what it should reject in Western advice.
       Michael Hudson: Distinguished Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri
Mr. Ben Mah is an acute observer. This book explodes the myth of Chinas Rise, reveals the truth about how Chinas economic policies have been misguided by neoliberalism. This is a good book that anyone concerned about Chinas future should not miss.
       Genliang Jia, Professor, Peoples University of ChinaAndong Zhu
The essays in this book deserve great attention.
       Dajun Zhong, renowned economist
Mr. Mahs work could help us re-think the related policies and eliminate the influence of neoliberal ideology. 
Andong Zhu, Director, Qinghua University, China
Mr. Mahs work is a biting revelation of the unpleasant reality that lies behind such currently popular buzzwords as privatization, marketization, freedom of capital flow and free trade.  Haibo Liu Chinese Academy of Social Sciences" />
