  <title>Paradise Redefined - Vanessa Fong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2004, Vanessa Fong offered a groundbreaking ethnographic exploration of the social, economic, and psychological development of children born since China&#39;s one-child policy was introduced in 1979. Her book &lt;I&gt;Only Hope&lt;/I&gt; left readers with a picture of stressed, ambitious adolescents for whom elite status was the ultimate goal, though relatively few were in a position to achieve it.
In &lt;I&gt;Paradise Redefined&lt;/I&gt;, Fong tracks the experiences of many in her initial cohort of Chinese only-children—now college-age—as they study abroad in Australia, Europe, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and Singapore. While earning a prestigious college education in China is the main path to elite status, study abroad provides an alternative channel by offering a particularly flexible &quot;developed world&quot; citizenship. This flexible citizenship promises the potential for greater happiness and freedom afforded by transnational mobility, but also brings with it unexpected suffering, ambivalence, and disappointment. &lt;I&gt;Paradise Redefined&lt;/I&gt; offers insights into China&#39;s globalization by examining the expectations and experiences that affect how various Chinese students make decisions about studying abroad, staying abroad, immigration, and returning home." />
