  <title>The NewsBreaker - Larry Garrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When it comes to high-level journalism, you&#39;re either &quot;in the know&quot; or you&#39;re out of business. Larry Garrison is in the know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part producer, part storyteller, and part news broker, Garrison has made a living for twenty-five years by staying one step ahead of media powerhouses like CNN and FOX News. In an industry filled with sensationalism and a lust for ratings, Garrison gets to the source of breaking news and ensures that the media presents his clients&#39; true stories. And what stories he has to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The NewsBreaker&lt;/em&gt;, Garrison flings the door open on the biggest headlines in recent memory, providing never-before-released scoop on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Schiavo&#39;s asking price for the story surrounding Terry Schiavo&#39;s death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The controversy surrounding the Pentagon tragedy on 9/11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The jurors who were persuaded to acquit Michael Jackson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much, much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You haven&#39;t heard the full story until you&#39;ve heard Garrison&#39;s unique and gripping first-hand account of the news behind the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I appreciate and thank Larry for his efforts in our search for answers in the disappearance of my daughter, Natalee!&quot; ?Dave Holloway, co-author, &lt;em&gt;Aruba&lt;/em&gt; with R. Stephanie Good and Larry Garrison&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Larry Garrison has been there for all the big cases?from Robert Blake to Natalee Holloway and Michael Jackson, he gets the scoop every time! &lt;em&gt;The NewsBreaker&lt;/em&gt; is the ultimate ride for fans of high-profile criminal trials and anyone else who wants the story behind the story!&quot; ?Wendy J. Murphy, New England School of Law, &lt;em&gt;CBS News &lt;/em&gt;Legal Analyst&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Larry has the nose and tenacity of a bulldog for finding controversial stories some might not want told, and others wish they could find. His story is a treasure trove of dazzling anecdotes and compelling tales that promise to grab your attention.&quot; ?Theresa Coffino, Executive producer, &lt;em&gt;EXTRA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Knowing Larry since my days with the White House Press Office, and working with him on major sweeps stories on &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/em&gt; has proven that he is a true journalist and a fine executive producer.&quot; ?Edward Lozzi, Beverly Hills Public Relations Executive, Former White House Aide&lt;/p&gt;" />
