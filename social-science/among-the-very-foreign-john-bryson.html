Parties All Over Town.&lt;br /&gt;The Handover of Hong Kong to China, commissioned by News Limited for the Handover Issue.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The handing back to China of Hong Kong was cause for celebration for most Chinese all over the world. In Hong Kong parties were everywhere, some by Chinese who had been waiting on this for decades, some by westerners who had made much money under colonial rule and whose partying was nostalgic, as those for the Merchant Bankers and in the British and the American Clubs. The stories of those parties reflect the ways continuing expatriates hope their fortunes should carry into their future." />
