  <title>Kid Food - Bettina Elias Siegel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;Most parents start out wanting to raise healthy eaters. Then the world intervenes. &lt;/strong&gt;
In &lt;em&gt;Kid Food&lt;/em&gt;, nationally recognized writer and food advocate Bettina Elias Siegel explores one of the fundamental challenges of modern parenting: trying to raise healthy eaters in a society intent on pushing children in the opposite direction. Siegel dives deep into the many influences that make feeding children healthfully so difficult-from the prevailing belief that kids will only eat highly processed &quot;kid food&quot; to the near-constant barrage of &quot;special treats.&quot;
Written in the same engaging, relatable voice that has made Siegel&#39;s web site &lt;em&gt;The Lunch Tray&lt;/em&gt; a trusted resource for almost a decade, &lt;em&gt;Kid Food&lt;/em&gt; combines original reporting with the hard-won experiences of a mom to give parents a deeper understanding of the most common obstacles to feeding children well:
- How the notion of &quot;picky eating&quot; undermines kids&#39; diets from an early age-and how parents&#39; anxieties about pickiness are stoked and exploited by industry marketing
- Why school meals can still look like fast food, even after well-publicized federal reforms
- Fact-twisting nutrition claims on grocery products, including how statements like &quot;made with real fruit&quot; can actually mean a product is less healthy
- The aggressive marketing of junk food to even the youngest children, often through sophisticated digital techniques meant to bypass parents&#39; oversight
- Children&#39;s menus that teach kids all the wrong lessons about what &quot;their&quot; food looks like
- The troubling ways adults exploit kids&#39; love of junk food-including to cover shortfalls in school budgets, control classroom behavior, and secure children&#39;s love
With expert advice, time-tested advocacy tips, and a trove of useful resources, &lt;em&gt;Kid Food&lt;/em&gt; gives parents both the knowledge and the tools to navigate their children&#39;s unhealthy food landscape-and change it for the better." />
