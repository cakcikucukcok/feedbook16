  <title>Older Sexy Ladies Lori and Beth Love to Play Volume 1 to 3 - Kat Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beth and Lori had taken Steve and dressed him up as a woman, took him over to his friend&#39;s house and told them that &quot;Cherry&quot;, Steve&#39;s whore name, was a whore in training and needed critique on &quot;her&quot; techniques. Little did Steve&#39;s three best friends know that it was, in fact, their long time best friend who was in front of them.     To his surprise, Beth interrupted the events to take him to the bathroom &quot;to clean up for Mike&quot;. When Steve got a look in the mirror, he could see why and he actually thanked her. His wig had shifted slightly, his make-up was coming off and his lipstick was all gone and smeared on the satisfaction of his two friends.     They probably hadn&#39;t taken a good look at him before Beth got him out of the room, but if they had, they might have suspected something. If they suspected something, they might have investigated. And that would have been a disaster!   Suitably &quot;freshened up&quot; he returned to finish the job." />
