  <title>The Socialization of the African American Child: - Sekou Clincy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The main objective of this book is to afford readers a comprehensive view of the current state of the African American experience from the perspective of a child and youth. Oftentimes, members within and outside the African American community fail to objectively critique this culture. The worst of the culture is perpetuated due to the lack of understanding of the origins of African American history and how that history relates to the socialization process. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book also explores the generational influence in socializing African American children. Beginning with the Great Depression generation to the hip-hop and generation Y generations, the norms and values past down to African American children are examined. As significant as passing down norms and values are, most normally little stock is given by parents toward instilling a sense of honor for community environment and service to others.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From society&#39;s viewpoint, most Americans feel that only African Americans can shape the development of black children and youth- - a great misconception. There are many white, Native American, Hispanic and Asian teachers involved in the development of African American children. On average, black children/youth spend an average of seven hours in school with educators of all races and ethnicities. However, very few to none of these experiences are in institutional settings where their culture is at the center of learning. Is African American culture on a path towards extinction? Are African American parents and immediate caregivers preparing their children to effectively function in a global technological age?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is African American culture on a path towards extinction? Are African American parents and immediate caregivers preparing their children to properly function in a global technological age? These questions and more will be addressed in this book. &lt;/P&gt;
