  <title>Dispossessed: Stories from India&#39;s Margins - Ashwin Parulkar, Saba Sharma, Amod Shah et al.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2005, starving members of the Bhuiya clan in one of Bihar&amp;rsquo;s poorest villages dug up a long-buried dead goat, cooked and ate it. Sixteen people died within days, twelve of them children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bengali-speaking Muslims who had moved to Rajasthan from West Bengal in the 1970s and &amp;rsquo;80s were summarily declared Bangladeshi terrorists in the aftermath of the 2008 Jaipur bomb blasts. They remain stateless in their own country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landless Lodhas, members of an erstwhile &amp;lsquo;Criminal Tribe&amp;rsquo; in Bihar, grapple even today with centuries of shame and dispossession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stories&amp;mdash;along with those of women with mental and physical disabilities in rural areas, homeless men living in Yamuna Pushta, in New Delhi, and patients in a leprosy colony in Orissa&amp;mdash;reveal both stigma and support, harsh lives, an uncaring, corrupt state and moments of resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawn from interviews and conversations as part of a study on destitution by the Centre for Equity Studies,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Dispossessed: Stories from India&amp;rsquo;s Margins&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;takes a wide-ranging view of what it meansto be destitute, displaced and marginalizedin contemporary India. Equally importantly, through these personal accounts of their research, the authors explore their own privilegesin comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written with sensitivity and care, this is an important book that perceptively questions India&amp;rsquo;s engagement with the people at its marginsand should be essential reading for all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
