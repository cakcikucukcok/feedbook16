      <meta name="description" content="Blonde, beautiful, teenage Kelly could never forgive her step-father for what he&#39;d just done.  Full-bodied, bosomy brunette Laurel Wilson was Kelly&#39;s teacher. In high school, Kelly was just one of the many students who took English class from Laurel. But, outside of school - well! In the privacy of Laurel&#39;s apartment, Kelly took much more intimate lessons, where not English, but French, was the subject taught. Kelly lay on Laurel&#39;s bed - Laurel took down Kelly&#39;s blue jeans - only a pair of thin panties stood between Laurel and her goal. And now that goal was in sight, for Laurel had taken down the panties, exposing Kelly. Moaning with hungry desire, Kelly, spread her legs so Laurel could kneel between them and give her more advanced lessons - in lesbian love!" />
