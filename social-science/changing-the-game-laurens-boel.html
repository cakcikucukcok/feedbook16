  <title>Changing the Game - Laurens Boel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life only has the meaning we choose to give it (Les Brown). The meaning we give life is created through the way in which we interpret life: through our filters. The question is, can we change those filters? 
Join Laurens on a whimsical ride through his genuine and open life experiences that shed light on various mind-setaltering tools that he has used to become an author, personal development coach, and inspirational speaker. 
The book consists of five chapters that cover (i) self-awareness, the cornerstone to emotional intelligence and crucial to understanding your thoughts and redirecting your focus to empower your reality; (ii) challenging your negative thoughts in a safe and empowering way that you are able to move forward and unlock your greatness; (iii) ten perspectives that you can use to take charge of your life and learn to view situations using a different lens; and (iv) goal setting and taking action, because without action things in your life will not change. This chapter offers tools and methodologies, successfully tried and tested, to empower a change in perspective. Last is (v) encouragement to realize that your life is a culmination of your thoughts, actions, and goals that you have defined for yourself. 
It is your responsibility and your privilege to change your life, but first, you have to change yourself." />
