  <title>The Colonisation of Europe - Guillaume Faye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this book, Guillaume Faye, the firebrand of the French New Right, confronts the phenomenon of mass immigration head-on. Rather than talking about &amp;lsquo;immigration&amp;rsquo;, Faye insists that we must speak of a massive colonisation settlement of the West by peoples from the Global South. This, together with declining birthrates, means that Europeans will soon become a minority in Europe, and their ancient and unique heritage will disappear. He furthermore demonstrates that the Islamic world is carrying out a hostile takeover both of France and Europe, with &amp;lsquo;youth delinquency&amp;rsquo; and terrorism being the first indicators of a coming ethnic civil war as Europe is overwhelmed through its porous borders. All of these facts are taboo for Europe&amp;rsquo;s leaders and &amp;lsquo;intellectuals&amp;rsquo;, who are working to organise Europe&amp;rsquo;s demise. This is a more serious threat than all the plagues and wars ever experienced by Europe. Likewise, Faye directs criticism at some of his former colleagues in the New Right for failing to grasp the reality of the situation. He calls to prepare for the only meaningful answer to this crisis: the Reconquista.&lt;/p&gt;" />
