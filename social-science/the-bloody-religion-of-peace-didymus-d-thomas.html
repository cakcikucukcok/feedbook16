  <title>The Bloody Religion of Peace - Didymus D Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Intrusive Islam has turned the writer Edward Bulyer-Lyttons 1839 metonymic adage on its head. No longer do we find the pen is mightier than the sword. Today, ideological Islam malevolently believes that the sword is mightier than the pen. Muslims resoundingly reject the edict that civilized communication is immutably preferable to gratuitous violence. For the Mohammadens the spilling of blood has extirpated the flow of ink. Fourteen centuries have elapsed, and nothing whatsoever has changed. Islam still savagely lives and dies by the sword.
The Bloody Religion of Peace was first conceived by its writer in the terror-sponsoring state of Qatar. However, this work was not actually born until the author set foot in the vast country of Canada. As the pages are turned, we instantly discover that it is a transparent testimony to the uncompromising truth, that Islam has roots that are rotten and that it is therefore incapable of producing any fruit. There is only one hope for the one billion Muslims worldwide, and it is not Allah or Muhammad.
Didymus D. Thomas has skillfully demonstrated that Islam is intrinsically a dark deception and that its followers are perilously close to running the risk of being consigned to corruption. The penning of this perspicacious piece has succeeded in attracting an avalanche of attention from all quarters, including both sides of the Atlantic." />
