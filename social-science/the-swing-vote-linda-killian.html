  <title>The Swing Vote - Linda Killian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As our country&#39;s politicians engage in bitter partisan battles, focused on protecting their own jobs but not on doing the nation&#39;s business, and political pundits shout louder and shriller to improve their ratings, it&#39;s no wonder that Americans have little faith in their government. But is America as divided as the politicians and talking heads would have us  believe? Do half of Americans stand on the right and the other half on the left with a no-man&#39;s-land between them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardly. Forty percent of all American voters are Independents who occupy the ample political and ideological space in the center. These Americans are anything but divided, and they&#39;re being ignored. These Independents make up the largest voting bloc in the nation and have determined the outcome of every election since World War II. Every year their numbers grow, as does the unconscionable disconnect between them and the officials who are supposed to represent them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Swing Vote: The Untapped Power of Independents&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of how our polarized political system is not only misrepresenting America but failing it. Linda Killian looks beyond the polls and the headlines and talks with the frustrated citizens who are raising the alarm about the acute bi-polarity, special interest-influence, and gridlock in Congress, asking why Obama&#39;s postpartisan presidency is anything but, and demanding realism, honest negotiation, and a sense of responsibility from their elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Killian paints a vivid portrait of the swing voters around the country and presents a new model that reveals who they are and what they want from their government and elected officials. She also offers a way forward, including solutions for fixing our broken political system. This is not only a timely shot across the bows of both parties but an impassioned call to Independents to bring America back into balance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
