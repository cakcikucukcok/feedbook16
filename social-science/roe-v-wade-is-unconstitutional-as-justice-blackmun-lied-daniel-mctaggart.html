  <title>Roe V. Wade Is Unconstitutional as Justice Blackmun Lied - Daniel McTaggart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is unique in that I say key ideas that no one else has even thought of. For example, there are three distinct proofs that the unborn is a human being and constitutional person. One is a conclusion of the American Medical Association in the early 1870s that has not been retracted (although overlooked by the modern AMA.) The second is a definition that can be found in many office dictionaries. I am the only one who knows about this. The third is an intentional error of omission by Justice Blackmun. In other words, there exist objective proofs that this unborn child is a fixture in the constitution. 
This means that the pro-lifers have been right all along, only missing the clinching arguments. 
No longer should abortions be performed for health, privacy or liberty principles. 
When the life of two humans clash it is a medical decision as to which shall live. For this reason I have suggested a new code of Ethics and Policy and Procedures to be followed. 
I also urge legislatures to essentially take a hands offs approach and enact legislation uniform in all the states, to the effect of leaving the matter entirely in the hands of state medical associations and societies. The law in California, Iowa and Nebraska and elsewhere should all be identical, in my view. Once Roe v. Wade is discredited, Doe V. Bolton is also no longer good law, so I urge out with the old, in with the new. 
I suggest that pro-life rallies on the streets be discontinued immediately and efforts at lobbying the medical profession and state lawmakers as soon as possible. 
Under my approach, abortions in the U.S. drop from 1 million per year to 1,000 or less." />
