  <title>Shakti&#39;s New Voice - Angela Rudert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Shakti&amp;rsquo;s New Voice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is the first comprehensive study of Anandmurti Gurumaa, a widely popular contemporary female guru from north India known for offering spiritual teachings and music on satellite television and the Internet. Based on extensive ethnographic fieldwork and religious-historical research&amp;mdash;as well as unexpected and unprecedented outsider contact with the guru&amp;mdash;Angela Rudert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;offers an intimate portrait of &amp;ldquo;Gurumaa&amp;rdquo; that will be of interest to the guru&amp;rsquo;s admirers as well as to scholars. To examine Gurumaa&amp;rsquo;s innovation, Rudert turns to examples drawn from fieldwork research in the guru&amp;rsquo;s ashram and from other locations in India and in the United States. These examples specifically discuss Gurumaa&amp;rsquo;s religious pluralism, her gender activism, and her embrace of new media, in order to illuminate elements of continuity and change within the time-honored South Asian tradition of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;guru-bhakti&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, devotion to the guru. Raised in a Sikh family, educated in a Catholic convent school and understood to have attained her enlightenment in Vrindavan, the famous Hindu pilgrimage site of Lord Krishna&amp;rsquo;s divine play, Gurumaa refuses identification with any particular religious tradition, or &amp;ldquo;ism,&amp;rdquo; yet her teachings draw from many. She speaks strongly, often harshly, about contemporary issues of gender inequality, while calling for women&amp;rsquo;s empowerment, and she has established a non-governmental organization called Shakti to promote girls&amp;rsquo; education in India. In the case of Anandmurti Gurumaa and those spiritual seekers in her fold, innovations and re-interpretations of tradition come from within the pluralistic setting of Indian religiosity, while they exist and act within a global religious milieu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
