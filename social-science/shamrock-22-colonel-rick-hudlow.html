  <title>Shamrock 22 - Colonel Rick Hudlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Air Force Colonels Memoir is a collection of stories about people whom he has known, worked with and flew with during his span of 80 plus years. Growing up was an on airport experience among airport people, none of whom are ordinary. He enlisted in the Army during WWII at 18 and entered the Army Flying Training System. He relives with the reader numerous experiences in his early flying and living years in France and Germany. He met and married a wonderful young Lady and shares her experiences in becoming a Colonels Lady. 
Colonel Hudlow volunteered into the new jet bomber program and also became a rated Navigator and Bombardier, an early qualification for flying the B-47. Reader will share his experiences as a junior officer and as he advances in rank and responsibility. He became expert in his profession and likely has as many flying hours in B-52 as anyone. He was introduced at SAC Headquarters as The finest refueler in SAC. He devoted his Headquarters years to improving the B-52 fleet combat effectiveness, and crew safety. His first hand comments on the problems related to the Vietnam War are astute. 
He was very disappointed to have been denied command of a SAC Bombardment Wing. SAC wanted him to shepherd the B-1 airplane development. General Dougherty told him that he was the only officer in SAC with the experience and qualifications to bring the B-1 airplane into the SAC inventory. He tried to negotiate being a Wing Commander for a year then do the B-1 job. That was not acceptable so he elected to retire and enter the business world. 
He took a position with a major aircraft manufacturer and was very successful rising to Director of International Sales. He provides astute comparisons of commercial business versus the business of the military at levels from the Pentagon down. 
A fascinating read of success, Patriotism, devotion to duty, family and bonded professionals as a B-52 Combat Crew during the most dangerous era in our nations history, The Cold War." />
