  <title>Anti-Arab Racism in the USA - Steven Salaita</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Awarded a 2007 Myers Outstanding Book Award.
&quot;A sobering analysis of anti-Arab racism, from neo-conservative to liberal, rooted in America&#39;s settler colonial past and seeping into every corner of our lives. Steven Salaita takes the reader into the crisis of Arab-American communities in the wake of 9/11. Written with passion, this lucid account of the dangers of American imperialism paints a dark picture of the agenda of the Bush administration not only in the Arab world but also for people of color at home.&quot;  
Miriam Cooke, Professor, Duke University 
&quot;An impassioned and deeply compelling look at the origins, evolution, manifestations and implications of anti-Arab racism today. ... A tour-de-force.&quot;  
Lisa Suhair Majaj, co-editor, Etel Adnan: Critical Reflections on the Arab-American Writer and Artist and Intersections: Gender, Nation, and Community in Arab Women’s Novels
&quot;Salaita dives head-first into the heart of racism in America and uses his personal experiences to help readers understand the mechanics of racism as it applies to Arabs, Muslims and people who look Middle Eastern in the post-Sept. 11 world.&quot;  
Ray Hanania, journalist and filmmaker, author of I’m Glad I Look Like a Terrorist:  Growing up Arab in America and Arabs of Chicagoland  
&quot;A highly recommended read, not only for students of Middle East history, but for the average American who wants to know how we have become so intimately and yet so bitterly entwined with the people of the Middle East. ... Salaita has thoughtfully articulated a very regretful era of unabashed racism in American history.&quot;  
Ramzy Baroud, editor, Palestine Chronicle and author of Searching Jenin    
Today is a difficult time to be both Arab and American. Since 9/11 there has been a lot of criticism of America’s involvement in the middle east. Yet there has been little analysis of how America treats citizens of Arab or middle eastern origin within its own borders. 
Steven Salaita explores the reality of Anti-Arab racism in America. He blends personal narrative, theory and polemics to show how this deep-rooted racism affects everything from legislation to cultural life, shining a light on the consequences of Anti-Arab racism both at home and abroad.
Uniquely, the book shows how ingrained racist attitudes can be found within the progressive movements on the political left, as well as the right. Salaita argues that, under the guise of patriotism, Anti-Arab racism fuels support for policies such as the Patriot Act. 
Salaita breaks down the façade of Anti-Arab racism with an insightful analysis, arguing for the urgency of a commitment to openness and inclusion in today’s political climate." />
