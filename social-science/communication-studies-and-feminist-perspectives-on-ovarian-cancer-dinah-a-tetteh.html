  <title>Communication Studies and Feminist Perspectives on Ovarian Cancer - Dinah A. Tetteh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Communication Studies and Feminist Perspectives on Ovarian Cancer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;examines the embodied experience of ovarian cancer by critically analyzing impacts of normative social and medical discourses&amp;mdash;including discourses of risk, choice, early detection, lack of reliable screening tests for ovarian cancer, feminine beauty, and self-advocacy&amp;mdash;on women&amp;rsquo;s communicative responses to the disease and treatments. It argues that these discourses help discredit some ovarian cancer experiences, encourage a one-dimensional perspective on the disease, and divert attention from larger issues such as society&amp;rsquo;s disregard for women&amp;rsquo;s complaints about disease symptoms. Blanket promotion of these discourses essentializes women&amp;rsquo;s experiences of the disease, pointing out how normative beliefs about women&amp;rsquo;s health and illness are often flipped and repackaged as standard language to discuss women&amp;rsquo;s experiences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using interview data and scholarly work from communication studies, feminist studies, critical/cultural studies, anthropology, critical psychology, and other disciplines, this book suggests we give equal importance to personal experiences and medical/scientific research to advance knowledge about ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is a disease specific to women; as such, women&amp;rsquo;s experiences cannot be minimized in attempts to understand the disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
