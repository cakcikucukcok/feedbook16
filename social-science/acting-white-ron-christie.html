Ron Christie traces the complex history of the phrase, from &lt;i&gt;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin &lt;/i&gt;to the tensions between Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X to Bill Cosby&#39;s controversial NAACP speech in 2004. The author also writes candidly of being challenged by black students for his &quot;acting white,&quot; and also of being labeled a race traitor in Congress by daring to be Republican. This lucid chronicle reveals how this prevalent put-down sets back much of the hard-earned progress for all blacks in American society. Deftly argued and determinedly controversial, this book is certain to spur thoughtful discussion for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;" />

He traces the roots of the phrase back to Uncle Tom's Cabin, which "planted the seeds of the idea that black inferiority is the result of blacks seeking favor with whites," but he points to the Black Power movement as the real culprit in propagating the "acting white" slur.<br /><b><i>Acting White: The Curious History of a Racial Slur by Ron ...</i></b> | Everything with Christie is oversimplified in an effort to support his argument that many people are engaging in charging high-achieving Blacks with "acting white." Choosing "black names" as demonstration of "a level of black pride and awareness" is oversimplification, but interpretation is individual and is used to serve individual purposes.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Acting White - Ron Christie</a> </h3></p><hr/>
