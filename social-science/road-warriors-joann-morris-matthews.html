  <title>Road Warriors - JoAnn Morris Matthews</title>

    &lt;em&gt;Road Warriors &lt;/em&gt;
     Life Lessons is an inspiration. It is based on personal knowledge of experiences learned in driving lessons taught the author by her father.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Power dominates the driver of a vehicle as he takes the vehicle out onto an open road. The sense of command and control equally affects males and females.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Maneuvering a vehicle skillfully is not a childs experience to be taken lightly. There are lessons gleaned from the narrator of this book of real-life
    ventures. Schoolinstructed drivers education courses combined with parental supervision mold preteen and teen lessons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    This book demonstrates safety and guidance through actions bent toward humor and realism. Driving is &lt;strong&gt;a privilege &lt;/strong&gt;offered during teen
    years. That privilege comes with responsibility to be viewed seriously by all drivers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The humor illustrated in the storyline is easily adaptable to the readers everyday life involving the world of driving a vehicle. It is much easier to
    grin or laugh at another persons errors or mishaps than own them. Better to experience through third-party humor than actually feel the effects of any of
    the books scenarios.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Driving defensively is an art. Safety first does not mean much until driving students think of that safety in terms of his life and the lives of others on
    the road. One Life Lesson -- Remember sheet metal can be replaced; body parts are not easily repaired. Vehicles roll off an assembly line, not your body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    We encounter so many experiences up close and personal when learning to drive a vehicle. Let those experiences be due to safe, defensive driving
    techniques.
