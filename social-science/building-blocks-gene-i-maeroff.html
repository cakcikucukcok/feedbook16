  <title>Building Blocks - Gene I. Maeroff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A student&#39;s entire journey along the educational spectrum is affected by what occurs--and, crucially, by what does not occur--before the age of eight or nine. Yet early learning has never received the attention it deserves and needs. In his latest book, education expert Gene Maeroff takes a hard look at early learning and the primary grades of schooling. &lt;i&gt;Building Blocks&lt;/i&gt; offers a concrete and groundbreaking strategy for improving early education. Filled with colorful descriptions and anecdotes from Maeroff&#39;s visits to schools around the country, &lt;i&gt;Building Blocks&lt;/i&gt; creates a rich portrait of education in America, ranging from math lessons imported from Singapore in Massachusetts to serious but joyful kindergartens in California. He speaks of the need for schools to prepare for the burgeoning enrollment of youngsters from immigrant families and for all children to acquire the habits and dispositions that will make them committed and productive students. Maeroff issues a call to action for policy makers and parents alike.&lt;/p&gt;" />
