  <title>Life is More Beautiful than Paradise - Khaled al-Berry, Humphrey Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1986, when this autobiography opens, the author is a typical fourteen-year-old boy in Asyut in Upper Egypt. Attracted at first by the image of a radical Islamist group as &quot;strong Muslims,&quot; his involvement develops until he finds himself deeply committed to its beliefs and implicated in its activities. This ends when, as he leaves the university following a demonstration, he is arrested. Prison, a return to life on the outside, and attending Cairo University all lead to Khaled al-Berry&#39;s eventual alienation from radical Islam.
This book opens a window onto the mind of an extremist who turns out to be disarmingly like many other clever adolescents, and bears witness to a history with whose reverberations we continue to live. It also serves as an intelligent and critical guide for the reader to the movement&#39;s unfamiliar debates and preoccupations, motives and intentions.
Fluently written, intellectually gripping, exciting, and often funny, &lt;em&gt;Life Is More Beautiful than Paradise&lt;/em&gt; provides a vital key to the understanding of a world that is both a source of fear and a magnet of curiosity for the west." />
