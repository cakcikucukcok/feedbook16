  <title>Haiti:  Re-Foundation of a Nation - Nicolas L. Pauyo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Th is book is one of the fi rst ever published on Haiti after the catastrophic Earthquake of January 12 2010. In Haiti:Th e Refoundation of a Nation we are introduced to the fruit of the authors long refl ection and diligent research on the nature of the Haitian state and its diffi cult evolution through more than two hundred years of history. In it, the author believes that Haitis errors began as far back as 1804, and therein lies the primary reason for its troubles. Th e state has unwittingly underdeveloped the country, thus any solution will inevitably work via the reconstruction eff orts of the state and contribute to the development, at last, of the Nation. Th e earthquake of January 12, 2010, that destroyed Port-au-Prince and all physical symbols of governance within, added to the already existing concept of reconstruction of the Haitian state not only institutional applications, but now also a physical, infrastructural aspect; crafting the state and also rebuilding its house. As it relates to infrastructure, Dr. Pauyo relies on the recommendations of experienced planners, geologists, architects and other scientifi c experts. He believes that it is time we learn to trust these scientists, those with knowledge and experience, and not amateurs or self-taught builders. Despite the challenges posed by the monstrous physical and institutional ruins of January 12th, Pauyos work is a bold endeavor towards discovery. Haiti must fl ush out the erroneous tracks leading her nowhere. Her sons and daughters, welded with the international community, must pave new paths for the full development of this country, and the emergence of a just society and a proud nation!&lt;/p&gt;" />
