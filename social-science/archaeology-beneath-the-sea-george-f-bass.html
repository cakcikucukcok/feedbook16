Between 1977 and 1979 he excavated at Serçe Liman?, Turkey, an 11th-century A.D. ship with three tons of broken glass; mended from a million shards over 20 years, it is the largest collection of medieval Islamic glass in existence. The National Geographic Society awarded him its La Gorce Gold Medal in 1979 and, in 1988, one of its fifteen Centennial Awards. In 1999 he received the JC Harrington Medal from The Society for Historical Archaeology. President George W. Bush presented him with the National Medal of Science in 2002. George Bass has written or edited ten books and over a hundred articles.
