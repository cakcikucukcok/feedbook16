  <title>Sweet Tooth - Kate Hopkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A cultural history of candy-how it evolved from medicine and a luxury to today&#39;s Kit Kat bars and M&amp;M&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told through the Kate Hopkins&#39; travels in Europe and the U.S&lt;i&gt;., Sweet Tooth&lt;/i&gt; is a first-hand account of her obsession with candy and a detailed look at its history and development. The sugary treats we enjoy today have a prominent past entertaining kings, curing the ill, and later developing into a billion-dollar industry. The dark side of this history is that the confectionery industry has helped create an environment of unhealthy overindulgence, has quelled any small business competition that was deemed to be a risk to any large company&#39;s bottom line, and was largely responsible for the slave trade that evolved during the era of colonization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candy&#39;s history is vast and complex and plays a distinct part in the growth of the Western world. Thanks to the ubiquity of these treats which allows us to take them for granted, that history has been hidden or forgotten. Until now. Filled with Hopkins&#39; trademark humor and accompanied by her Candy Grab Bag tasting notes, &lt;i&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/i&gt; is a must-read for everybody who considers themselves a candy freak.&lt;/p&gt;" />
