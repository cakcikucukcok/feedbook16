  <title>Red, White &amp; Blue-Collar - Jonathan E. Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;America, we are at a pivotal point in time. Our priorities are not in order, and our future is on the back burner. Greedy and proud, our self-righteous way of living has flushed our ethics down the drain, and it seems weve forgotten what this country was founded on. The path we are on as a nation is a dark and dangerous one that will ultimately lead to a land that is dry and desolate. America is on the brink of a moral, economic, and military collapse, and if we choose to not act upon our rights as US citizens, our country may be lost forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, though, there is hope! We each have a voice and the freedom with which to make ourselves heard. We each have a choice in every decision to be made as a nation. We each have the ability to make things change. Together we can reclaim our sweet land of liberty. This should be and can be a turning point for America, but we must unite to make it happen. Putting aside petty differences and aiming for common goals, we can change the future of America.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A new day has dawned, and our time is now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will put a fire beneath your seat and rev up your spirit. It will make you want to revive the American dream for yourself and your fellow man. It will offer hope to the hopeless, motivation to those lacking, and help to those who have lost faith in their country.&lt;/p&gt;" />
