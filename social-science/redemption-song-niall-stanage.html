  <title>Redemption Song - Niall Stanage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In little more than four years, Barack Obama rose from political obscurity to become the 44th president of the United States. His election win in November 2008 was a moment of enormous historical magnitude, greeted with an outpouring of emotion in the US and around the world. However, on taking office, Obama was faced with unparalleled challenges as the global economy plunged ever-deeper into crisis and the US struggled with the two wars in which it was enmeshed.In Redemption Song, Niall Stanage tells the extraordinary tale of Obama&#39;s journey from community organiser in Chicago to leader of the free world through exclusive interviews with some of the new president&#39;s oldest friends and closest advisors. He explores the then-senator&#39;s long and acrimonious tussle with Hillary Clinton, sheds new light on his battle with John McCain and running mate Sarah Palin, and hears from the members of the grassroots movement that carried Obama all the way to the Oval Office.He also provides an intimate account of the first phase of the Obama presidency, reporting from within the White House walls on the new Administration&#39;s first tests, triumphs and tribulations." />
