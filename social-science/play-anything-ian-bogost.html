      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;How filling life with play&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;whether soccer or lawn mowing, counting sheep or tossing Angry Birds&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;forges a new path for creativity and joy in our impatient age&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is boring: filled with meetings and traffic, errands and emails. Nothing we&#39;d ever call &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt;. But what if we&#39;ve gotten fun wrong? In &lt;i&gt;Play Anything,&lt;/i&gt; visionary game designer and philosopher Ian Bogost shows how we can overcome our daily anxiety; transforming the boring, ordinary world around us into one of endless, playful possibilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key to this playful mindset lies in discovering the secret truth of fun and games. &lt;i&gt;Play Anything,&lt;/i&gt; reveals that games appeal to us not because they are fun, but because they set &lt;i&gt;limitations&lt;/i&gt;. Soccer wouldn&#39;t be soccer if it wasn&#39;t composed of two teams of eleven players using only their feet, heads, and torsos to get a ball into a goal; Tetris wouldn&#39;t be Tetris without falling pieces in characteristic shapes. Such rules seem needless, arbitrary, and difficult. Yet it is the limitations that make games enjoyable, just like it&#39;s the hard things in life that give it meaning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Play is what happens when we &lt;i&gt;accept&lt;/i&gt; these limitations, narrow our focus, and, consequently, have fun. Which is also how to live a good life. Manipulating a soccer ball into a goal is no different than treating ordinary circumstances- like grocery shopping, lawn mowing, and making PowerPoints-as sources for meaning and joy. We can &quot;play anything&quot; by filling our days with attention and discipline, devotion and love for the world as it really is, beyond our desires and fears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ranging from Internet culture to moral philosophy, ancient poetry to modern consumerism, Bogost shows us how today&#39;s chaotic world can only be tamed-and enjoyed-when we first impose boundaries on ourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
