  <title>Inculcating Ethics and Citizenship Behaviour in Islamic Financial Institutions: the Issues and Consequences - Jihad Mohammad, Farzana Quoquab</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book enables its readers to understand Islamic ethics at workplace and its role in enhancing the performance and productivity of organizations. Moreover, this timely and important book is an essential guide for academician, researchers, and managers to enhance and enrich their understanding and knowledge about the effective role of Islamic work ethics.
The concept of work ethics is acknowledged as an important indicator of the likely success of all types of organizations. However, the bulk of research pertaining to work ethics and various organizational and individual outcomes has focused predominantly on the concept of Protestant work ethics and not much attention has been given to assess the notion of Islamic work ethics. Nonetheless, it is necessary to understand other work ethics from different religious faiths in order to get a better understanding about the work ethics phenomenon. This book aims to bridge this gap in literature and advance the knowledge regarding work ethics from the Islamic perspective. 
This book presents some insightful strategies for Islamic financial institutions to manage workplace ethics. Those who are eager to advance their knowledge about Islamic work ethics, organizational justice, and organizational citizenship behavior will find this book very useful." />
