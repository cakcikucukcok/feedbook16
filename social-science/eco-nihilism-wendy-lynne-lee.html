  <title>Eco-Nihilism - Wendy Lynne Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When asked what is the root cause of our current and unprecedented environmental crisis, climate change, many, particularly on the progressive Left, would refer to the excesses of capitalism&amp;mdash;and they&amp;rsquo;d be right. Among the aims in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Eco-Nihilism: The Philosophical Geopolitics of the Climate Change Apocalypse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, is to show that there are no versions of conquest capital compatible with the fact of a finite planet, and that a logic whose operating premise is growth is destined to not only exhaust our planetary resources, but generate profound social injustice and geopolitical violence in its pursuit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the violence and injustice of capital is selective&amp;mdash;some benefit greatly while others are subjugated. Wendy Lynne Lee argues that any comprehensive analysis of what Jason Moore has dubbed the Capitalocene, must include an equally probing account of human chauvinism, that is, the axes along which capital is supplied with resources and labor. Sex, gender, race, and species supply the circulatory system of capital not only labor and materials, but also &amp;ldquo;justification&amp;rdquo; for exploitation and oppression. Racism, heteropatriarchy, and speciesism come ready-made to the advantage of capitalist commodifiation, and without an understanding of these dynamics, we&amp;rsquo;ll remain doomed to settling for a sustainably unjust world as opposed to realizing a just and desirable one. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
