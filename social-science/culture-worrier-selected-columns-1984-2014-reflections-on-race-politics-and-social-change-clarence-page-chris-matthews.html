  <title>Culture Worrier: Selected Columns 1984-2014: Reflections on Race, Politics and Social Change - Clarence Page, Chris Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Pulitzer Prize winner Clarence Page is one of the most nationally recognized and highly regarded syndicated columnists in the country, and his newest book, &lt;I&gt;Culture Worrier: Selected Columns 1984&amp;#150;2014&lt;/I&gt;, commemorates the 30th anniversary of his column&#39;s first appearance in the &lt;I&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/I&gt;. It is the first such collection of his columns, and a long overdue archive of his best work, covering topics such as politics, social issues, pop culture, race, family, new media, prominent figures, as well as his own personal life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Page has been a broadcast mainstay for decades, delivering his sensible and balanced perspective on &lt;I&gt;The MacLaughlin Group&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&lt;/I&gt;, NPR&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Weekend Edition&lt;/I&gt;, MSNBC&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Chris Matthews Show&lt;/I&gt;, and many other popular shows. His column, which is featured in over 150 newspapers, provides keen and clever insight on the day&#39;s most pressing political and social issues. While Page is known for his liberal-leaning views, readers have always appreciated his unbiased approach in directing criticism across the political spectrum, to any individual person or general issue deserving of examination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Culture Worrier: Selected Columns 1984&amp;#150;2014&lt;/I&gt; is sure to be one of the most entertaining and fascinating column collections in recent years, bringing Page&#39;s unique perspective within the African-American and political communities, and wealth of fascinating experiential knowledge, to the foreground of our ongoing national dialogue. As a veteran media member who has lived through the transition from print&#39;s heyday to modern mobile publishing, from the Vietnam War through the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and from the Civil Rights movement to the election of Barack Obama, Page is one of the most revered and uniquely qualified commentators of our time. This book will certainly be a bookshelf staple for the informed who favor balanced criticism of major current affairs and political events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
