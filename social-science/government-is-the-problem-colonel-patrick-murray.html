  <title>Government Is the Problem - Colonel Patrick Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="---Love your country, not the government---
Colonel Patrick Murray (USA, retired) makes the compelling case that the biggest divide in America isnt racial disharmony, economic disparity, or Republican vs. Democrat. The biggest rift today is the widening gap between Washington, DC, and Main Street America. 
Our Founding Fathers created a unique system of limited government and individual liberty against a backdrop of free markets that ignited the greatest explosion of wealth, prosperity, and opportunity in history. However, the American Dream is now on life support. Government has become a massive parasite, leeching us of our liberty and productivity, and putting us on the path to civil unrest. The federal government, along with career politicians of both political parties, has become the problem.
The good news is that there is a way out. Americas Founders, who were all too familiar with the oppressive nature of government, included an escape hatch in Article 5 of the Constitution to deal with the very situation in which we find ourselves. It is the last best option for Americas citizens to impose change upon government.
Colonel Murrays book is a call to action at the grassroots level, an operations order on how to change the conditions on the political battlefield, take back our country, and restore the American Dream for future generations." />
