  <title>The Long Descent - John Michael Greer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;SeattleOil.com&amp;#160; &lt;/B&gt;The Internet writings of John Michael Greer - beyond any doubt the greatest peak oil historian in the English language - have finally made their way into print. Greer fans will recognize many of the book&#39;s passages from previous essays, but will be delighted to see them fleshed out here with additional examples and analysis.&lt;I&gt;The Long Descent&lt;/I&gt; is one of the most highly anticipated peak oil books of the year, and it lives up to every ounce of hype. Greer is a captivating, brilliantly inventive writer with a deep knowledge of history, an impressive amount of mechanical savvy, a flair for storytelling and a gift for drawing art analogies. His new book presents an astonishing view of our society&#39;s past, present and future trajectory--one that is unmatched in its breadth and depth. &lt;B&gt;Reviewed by&lt;/B&gt; &lt;B&gt;Frank Kaminski&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Wired.com&lt;/B&gt;&amp;#160; &lt;I&gt;The Long Descent &lt;/I&gt;is a welcome antidote to the armageddonism that often accompanies peak oil discussions. &quot;The decline of a civilization is rarely anything like so sudden for those who live through it&quot; writes Greer, encouragingly; it&#39;s &quot;a much slower and more complex transformation than the sudden catastrophes imagined by many soical critics today.&quot;&lt;br&gt;The changes that will follow the decline of world petroleum production are likely to be sweeping and global, Greer concludes, but from the perspective of those who live through them these changes are much more likely to take gradual and local forms. &lt;B&gt;Reviewed by Bruce Sterling&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;Americans are expressing deep concern about US dependence on petroleum, rising energy prices, and the threat of climate change. Unlike the energy crisis of the 1970s, however, there is a lurking fear that now the times are different and the crisis may not easily be resolved.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Long Descent&lt;/I&gt; examines the basis of such fear through three core themes:&lt;/P&gt;  &lt;UL&gt;  &lt;LI&gt;Industrial society is following the same well-worn path that has led other civilizations into decline, a path involving a much slower and more complex transformation than the sudden catastrophes imagined by so many social critics today.&lt;/LI&gt;  &lt;LI&gt;The roots of the crisis lie in the cultural stories that shape the way we understand the world. Since problems cannot be solved with the same thinking that created them, these ways of thinking need to be replaced with others better suited to the needs of our time.&lt;/LI&gt;  &lt;LI&gt;It is too late for massive programs for top-down change; the change must come from individuals.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hope exists in actions that range from taking up a handicraft or adopting an &amp;#8220;obsolete&amp;#8221; technology, through planting an organic vegetable garden, taking charge of your own health care or spirituality, and building community.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;Focusing eloquently on constructive adaptation to massive change, this book will have wide appeal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
