  <title>Mommy, Where’S Daddy? - Josette B. Nicolas, Floyd Ryan Yamyamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A mother, Mary, who didnt want her son, Joseph, to know he had a father, did everything she could to prevent anyone from talking about his father. She didnt even talk to Joseph about his father herself. But when the little boy started his preschool year, he soon found out that he must have a father because some of the other children had fathers who would bring them to the classroom and would pick them up in the afternoon. 
	After few weeks of observation, while Joseph and his mother were walking to school, Joseph decided to ask his mother about his father. Mommy, wheres Daddy? he asked. 
Mary responded, You dont have a daddy. 
Why do the other kids have daddies? asked Joseph with an alarmed voice.
I dont know, replied Mary. This answer hit Joseph so deeply that his behavior changed from good to bad to worse. His behavior changed positively when his mother had another baby, a boy named Sam, and the babys father, Julian, became Josephs surrogate daddy. 
For many years things were going well for Joseph and his familywhen on a winter Saturday morning, a fight broke out between Mary and Julian. The argument lasted for hours, and finally Julian took his luggage and left. 
The destruction of his family was another blow for Josephhe was devastated. Joseph and Sam reacted by staying out of school and moving out. They both shared a room with a group of fatherless kids who were making their living in the neighborhood streets. Joseph and Sam ended up in juvenile correction and their mother had to bail them out. After their release, they went back to school. Joseph became a lawyer, serving kids at risk, and Sam became the owner of a construction company." />
