  <title>Steel Boned Corset Chronicles: Her Comeback as a Dominatrix Volume 1 Thru 3 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I raised the paddle once again and landed it across her ass cheeks a second time. Little red circles appeared on her ass cheeks from the holes in the center of the leather paddle. She let out another scream.    Then I asked her the million dollar question. One that every Dom knows that no matter how they answer, it&#39;s a loaded question. Because if they say no, the outcome is the same as if they had said yes. And if they say yes, then how can we simply deny them what they want?    So, I asked it anyway, because I&#39;m a little sadistic in that way. &quot;Shall I paddle you again?&quot; I was also curious as to what her answer would be.    She was crying a little when she answered. &quot;No, mistress.&quot; She managed to get out with a sniffle.    &quot;Are you trying to tell me how to do my job?&quot;    &quot;No, mistress.&quot; She cried out.    &quot;Well, you just told me that I should not to paddle you anymore. That sounds like you are trying to tell me how to do my job.&quot; Damn, I can be a sadistic bitch when I want to be." />
