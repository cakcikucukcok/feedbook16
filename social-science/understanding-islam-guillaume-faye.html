  <title>Understanding Islam - Guillaume Faye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understanding Islam&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s view that, in spite of its appearance of having many internal divisions, the world of Islam understands only one enemy: its own civilisation versus all others. Guillaume Faye proposes that there is no difference other than tactical ones between Islam and Islamism. According to Faye, Islam is absolutely incompatible with pluralist democracy, secularism, and the Western conception of freedom. Its purpose is theocracy, and its reign means decline in intelligence. &lt;em&gt;Understanding Islam&lt;/em&gt; calls for Westerners to refuse to submit to its values and accept its principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Christians, especially Catholics, &amp;ldquo;respect&amp;rdquo; the Muslim religion nowadays, although this attitude is not mutual (since Christians face persecution in almost all Islamic countries). Islam has always considered Christianity and Judaism to be fraught with lies and errors, which is its right. That the Church should ever praise and respect Islam is a sign of submission, resignation and surrender. This frightful tolerance displayed by Christians towards Islam began with the Second Vatican Council, when the &lt;em&gt;Nostra Aetate&lt;/em&gt; declaration expressed a preference for Islam in comparison with non-Christian religions, agnosticism and paganism, whereas Islam has always condemned and rejected Christianity and abhorred Judaism, as confirmed by several Koranic Suras.&amp;rsquo; &amp;mdash; p. 19&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Islam thus benefits from an exorbitant privilege not only in the public sphere but also in the legal domain. It is the only religion (and ideology) which one is forbidden to attack. One is allowed to vilify, ridicule, challenge, refute and mock Marxists, liberals, Catholics (more than anyone else!), Evangelists, Hasidic Jews, Hindus and countless others, but not Muslims and Islam. Islam enjoys a kind of mental extraterritoriality, which is more than Muslims could have ever wished for. We are presenting them with our severed hands and tongues on a silver platter. Our native censors have integrated the very principles of Islam into their frightened brains (meaning that they have undergone low intensity Islamisation or have become pre-Islamised): Islam is not subject to criticism or ridicule, but is to be respected and praised everywhere and at all times.&amp;rsquo; &amp;mdash; p. 97&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;In the eyes of the Islamic doctrine, the world is divided into three parts: firstly, there is &lt;em&gt;Dar al-Islam&lt;/em&gt;, meaning the Domain of Islam, where the latter has established itself permanently and Islamic order reigns. Next, we have &lt;em&gt;Dar al-Harb&lt;/em&gt;, the Domain of War, comprising lands that are to be conquered and claimed from the &lt;em&gt;harbis &lt;/em&gt;(the &amp;ldquo;infidels&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;heretics&amp;rdquo;). Finally, there is &lt;em&gt;Dar al-Sulh&lt;/em&gt;, the Domain of Conciliation, in which true Muslims are either non-existent or not sufficiently numerous to take action. Currently, Western Europe is considered to be &lt;em&gt;Dar al-Harb&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rsquo; &amp;mdash; p. 266&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;" />
