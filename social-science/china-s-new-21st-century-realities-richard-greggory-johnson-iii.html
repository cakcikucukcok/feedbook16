  <title>China’s New 21st-Century Realities - Richard Greggory Johnson Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;China’s New 21&lt;UP&gt;st&lt;/UP&gt;-Century Realities: Social Equity in a Time of Change&lt;/I&gt; examines the new social justice realities in China. Often when people think of China they think of a very rigid, patriarchal society where oppression is the order of the day. However, this book aims to debunk some of those preconceived notions by addressing issues such as single men living in rural China, professional women in politics, and the baggage that comes with being considered an outsider. The book looks at China through a critical social justice prism that has seldom been used before. Contributors also take on race and ethnicity as a means to understanding that China, like many nations in the world, is becoming increasingly diverse in many areas including religion and gender roles. This book is a must read for anyone that is truly interested in unlearning what they believe they know about human rights in China." />
