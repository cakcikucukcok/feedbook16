  <title>Making It: Why Manufacturing Still Matters - Louis Uchitelle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;From the longtime &lt;EM&gt;New York Times&lt;/EM&gt; economics correspondent, a closely reported argument for the continuing importance of industry for American prosperity&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the 1950s manufacturing generated nearly 30 percent of U.S. income. Over the past fifty-five years that share has gradually declined to less than 12 percent at the same time that real estate, finance, and Wall Street trading have grown. While manufacturing&#39;s share of the U.S. economy shrinks, it expands in countries such as China and Germany that have a strong industrial policy. Meanwhile Americans are only vaguely aware of the many consequences-including a decline in their self-image as inventive, practical, and effective people-of the loss of that industrial base. And yet, with the improbable rise of Donald Trump, the consequences of the hollowing out of America&#39;s once-vibrant industrial working class can no longer be ignored.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reporting from places where things were and sometimes still are &quot;Made in the USA&quot;-Albany, New York, Boston, Detroit, Fort Wayne, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.-longtime &lt;EM&gt;New York Times&lt;/EM&gt; economics correspondent Louis Uchitelle argues that the government has a crucial role to play in making domestic manufacturing possible. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Combining brilliant reportage with an incisive economic and political argument, &lt;EM&gt;Making It&lt;/EM&gt; tells the overlooked story of manufacturing&#39;s still-vital role in the United States and how it might expand.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
