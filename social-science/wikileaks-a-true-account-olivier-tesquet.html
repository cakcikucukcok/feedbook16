  <title>WikiLeaks, a true account - Olivier Tesquet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;     &lt;span&gt;       &lt;span&gt;Is  the founder of WikiLeaks the ministering angel of press freedom as his  pale appearance might suggest? Or is he the demonic leader of the most  dangerous hacker collective on the web? As one outspoken critic  suggests, is he “worse than the Stasi,” &lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span&gt;r  does he represent  hope for those struggling against oppression? Either  way, by the end of 2010 it became clear that a hitherto unknown  organization had forever changed the global media landscape. Within a  few months, some of the best-known newspapers - &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Der  Spiegel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt; - began to woo this small group of  enthusiastic members of information transparency movement. &lt;/span&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt;To understand this movement, one that overturns the hierarchy of information and&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span&gt; threatens the interests of American diplomacy, it’s necessary to dig into the stories of these&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span&gt; men  and women, their ideology, and their unique activism. For months  Olivier Tesquet, journalist at OWNI.fr, followed Assange’s clan from  London to Berlin. Working long hours to complete his investigation,  Olivier was able to unveil WikiLeaks’ goals and the personalities of its  key leaders. &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;     &lt;span&gt;       &lt;span&gt;His full immersion into the most creative part of the web  breaks down certain misconceptions - for better or for worse. &lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;
