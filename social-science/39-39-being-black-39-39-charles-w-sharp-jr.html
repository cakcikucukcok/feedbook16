  <title>&#39;&#39;Being Black&#39;&#39; - Charles W. Sharp Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;My book is an autobiography of my
life. It shows the up and downs of the Black Man living in a society in which
he really has no great impact on his way of living, outside of getting an
education, and trying to be an upright man. There were some good and bad times
in my life, some of which I had no control over, some of which I regret making
the wrong choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;I would like the young readers to
understand that there are many obstacles placed in your way on the road from
young man to adulthood. It is up to them to make the choices in their life that
will set them apart from the average Black Man in &lt;st1:country-region&gt;&lt;st1:place&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;
today. We have been stigmatized and harassed over the years, but we must be
able to stand tall and hold our heads high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Bring your children up instilling
in them right from wrong, and let them know they can make a difference in this
world today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The book shows the good times,
many bad times and the will I had to be a good American, and man overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Funny  Sad  Loveable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
