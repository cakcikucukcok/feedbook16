  <title>Border Insecurity - Sylvia Longmire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When confronted with the challenges of border security and illegal immigration, government officials are fond of saying that our borders have never been as safe and secure as they are now. But ranchers in the borderlands of Arizona and Texas fear for their lands, their cattle, their homes, and sometimes their lives due to the human  and drug smuggling traffic that regularly crosses their property. Who is right? What does a secure border actually look like? More importantly,  is a secure border a realistic goal for the United States? &lt;i&gt;Border Insecurity&lt;/i&gt; examines all the aspects of the challenge--and thriving industry--of trying to keep terrorists, drug smugglers, and illegal immigrants from entering the United  States across our land borders. It looks at on-the-ground  issues and controversies like the border fence, the usefulness of technology, shifts in the connection between illegal immigration and drug smuggling, and the potential for terrorists and drug cartels to work together.&lt;i&gt; Border Insecurity&lt;/i&gt; also delves into how the border debate itself is part of why the government has failed to improve information sharing and why this is necessary to establish a clear and comprehensive border security strategy." />
