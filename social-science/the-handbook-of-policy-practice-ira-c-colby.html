  <title>The Handbook of Policy Practice - Ira C. Colby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All social work practice, from intervention to how payments or reimbursements are made, is regulated by social policies. Professionals, however, cannot arbitrarily select which policy to follow in any circumstance; knowing what comprises a given policy is essential, but equally important is understanding how to amend a policy by applying unique skills that reflect the social work profession&#39;s shared values and beliefs. Recognizing that a series of interdependent social policies govern every aspect of social work in both nonprofit and public organizations, this practice-specific textbook focuses on influencing social policies in an agency setting or through formal governmental processes.
The &lt;em&gt;Handbook for Policy Practice&lt;/em&gt; explores a wide range of topics that are critical tools in every social worker&#39;s policy practice repertoire:
&amp;#183; Recognizing the various social justice theories and their role in social policy.
&amp;#183; Understanding critical thinking as a practice skill.
&amp;#183; Social media as a practice tool.
&amp;#183; Preparing and presenting testimony to a legislative committee or group of people.
&amp;#183; Formulating a clear, well-focused written policy brief for a Board of Directors or legislative committee.
&amp;#183; Organizing policy specific advocacy activities including a public forum, social work day at the legislature, and voter registration projects.
&amp;#183; The &quot;30-second elevator speech.&quot;
&amp;#183; Writing newspaper &quot;op-eds&quot; and &quot;letters to the editor.&quot;
Purposefully, the &lt;em&gt;Handbook&lt;/em&gt; also relies on information comes from the digital world. Using the web as a primary source builds on the social work profession&#39;s long-held belief &lt;em&gt;to begin where the client is&lt;/em&gt;. Using the links to the various data and citation sources, readers will learn to identify and discern the features of a valid web site. As a whole, this book is an essential resource for all BSW and MSW students." />
