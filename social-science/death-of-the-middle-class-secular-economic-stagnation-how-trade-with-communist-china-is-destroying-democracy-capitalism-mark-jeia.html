  <title>Death of the Middle Class + Secular Economic Stagnation = How Trade with Communist China Is Destroying Democracy &amp; Capitalism - Mark Jeia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A rousing call to halt trade with China and reinvigorate truly liberal economic trade policy a complex argument shorn of hypertechnical language, composed in a breezy, informal style
 Kirkus Review
 Concise, reasonable and clear exploration of one of todays most pressing political and economic issues: international trade unblemished by jargon characteristic of tomes proclaiming a complex economic theory 
Blue Ink Review
 Despite the hefty subject matter, Death of the Middle Class is solidly written and is easy to follow, forgoing most economic jargon. 
Clarion Review 
The book discusses the economic problems we face in the world today, especially in developed countries, and the growing threat to western political systems. It clarifies how the established framework of liberal economics has been misrepresented to justify free trade and immigration with a large, low-wage country such as China. And it shows what liberal economic theory actually says about it  how it impacts the supply and demand balance of labour, the incentives for labour-saving technological innovation (the main driver of living standards in history), the global capitalist system for allocation of scarce resources and the normal functioning of all markets in the world. 
Finally, the book examines some alternative explanations and policies that have been advanced, and explains how they are at best a dangerous distraction and at worst harmful. Government spending. Monetary policy interest rates and QE. Reforms. The role of technology. Demographics  people getting older. Inequality." />
