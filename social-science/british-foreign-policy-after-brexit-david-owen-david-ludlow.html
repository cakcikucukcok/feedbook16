  <title>British Foreign Policy After Brexit - David Owen, David Ludlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;British Foreign Policy after Brexit by David Owen and David Ludlow is, perhaps surprisingly, a book written by two people from different generations who voted on opposite sides in the 2016 referendum. One a politician, the other a former diplomat, they both have significant business experience in world markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors demonstrate how Britain&#39;s global role and influence can be enhanced rather than diminished post-Brexit, with a diplomatic, security, development and trade agenda based on hard-headed realism, including a review of budgetary priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a firmly European country, they see the UK as a key player with Germany and France in the wider Europe, and a leader in security issues threatening the continent&#39;s stability. They do not regard the relationship with Moscow as inevitably confrontational, but believe strengthening NATO is essential and a top priority to contain Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wider world, a reinvigorated UK-US relationship will be critical, but must accommodate differences in some core areas, e.g. in dealing with China. Furthermore, they see the UK&#39;s new aircraft carrier at the heart of a UN Rapid Reaction Force drawn mainly from Commonwealth countries, including Australia, Canada, India and New Zealand, and supporting operations around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
