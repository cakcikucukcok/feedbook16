  <title>Classical Economics Today - Marcella Corsi, Jan Kregel, Carlo D&#39;Ippoliti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;&gt;“Classical Economics Today: Essays in Honor of Alessandro Roncaglia” is a collection of essays that investigates and applies the method and principles of Classical political economy to current issues of economic theory and policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;&gt;The contributors to the volume, like all classical economists in general, regard history as a useful tool of analysis rather than a specialist object of investigation. By denying that a single, all-encompassing mathematical model can explain everything we are interested in, Classical political economy necessarily requires a comparison and integration of several pieces of theory as the only way to discuss economics and economic policy. Economists inspired by the Classical approach believe that economic theory is historically conditioned: as social systems evolve, the appropriate theory to represent a certain phenomenon must evolve too. Therefore, plurality in methods, including the history of economic thought, must be a deliberate choice, as evidenced by the essays in “Classical Economics Today: Essays in Honor of Alessandro Roncaglia.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;&gt;“Classical Economics Today” is a tribute to Alessandro Roncaglia, to his personality and his research interests. Roncaglia’s research is based on Schumpeter’s dictum that good economics must encompass history, economic theory and statistics, and therefore does not generally take the form of elegant formal models that are applicable to all and everything. In this direction, Roncaglia is inspired by the Classical economists of the past, and becomes a model for present-day Classical economists. A perceptible family air imbues the essays: all the contributors are friends of Roncaglia and see his personality and his interests as a common point of reference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
