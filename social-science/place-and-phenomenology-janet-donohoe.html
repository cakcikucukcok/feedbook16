  <title>Place and Phenomenology - Janet Donohoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This cross-disciplinary book uses phenomenological method and description to explore questions of place, underscoring the significance of phenomenology for place and place for phenomenology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book brings together prominent scholars in phenomenology of place. Covering a range of issues from sacred places to embodiment and identity and from environmental art and architecture to limit places, the contributors explore theoretical foundations through thinkers such as Heidegger, Marion-Young, Husserl, and Leopold among others. Phenomenological method and description are brought to bear on concrete places such as rivers, the Himalayas, modern transit, sacred architecture and more. The book is accessible and pertinent to on-going discussions in human geography, architectural theory, environmental studies, and philosophy of place. Provocative and imaginative, the essays provide a much-needed look at the contributions of phenomenology to, as well as the role of place in, contemporary philosophical and environmental discussions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
