  <title>The Second Colonial Occupation - Bekeh Utietiang Ukelina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this insightful book, development historian Bekeh Utietiang Ukelina addresses the crisis of development in Africa by locating it in its colonial historical past. Using Nigeria as a case study, he argues that the nature and practice of British colonialism in this colony created social and economic deficiencies that have left a legacy of underdevelopment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ukelina outlines the processes that led to the 1945 Nigerian Development Plan and the evolution of colonial agricultural policy and practices in Nigeria. He argues that a few key factors led to the failure of development in the late colonial period: the imperial and neocolonial imperative to exploit African resources and people, poor planning as a result of this imperative, and the racial ideologies of the colonial state that resulted in a total rejection of local African experience and knowledge in favor of Western &amp;lsquo;experts.&amp;rsquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Second Colonial Occupation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; uncovers and analyzes the short and long term impact of colonialism. It reveals that though colonial rule was promoted as a benevolent mission, at heart, it was a system that guaranteed that Africans continuously paid for their own exploitation. Ukelina argues that &amp;lsquo;postcolonial&amp;rsquo; Africa will continue to face development challenges unless it breaks free from the intellectual relics of colonial rule and the economic shackles of neocolonialism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
