  <title>Women Theorists on Society and Politics - Lynn McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Revolution, abolition of slavery, public health care, welfare, violence against women, war and militarism — such issues have been debated for centuries. But much work done by women theorists on these traditional social and political topics is little known or difficult to obtain. This new anthology contains significant excerpts not normally included in standard collections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Women Theorists on Society and Politics&lt;/i&gt; brings together scarce, previously unpublished and newly translated excerpts from works by such women theorists as Emilie du Châtelet, Germaine de Staël, Catharine Macaulay, Mary Wollstonecraft, Flora Tristan, Harriet Martineau, Florence Nightingale, Beatrice Webb and Jane Addams. It focuses on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writers, but also includes some selections from as early as the Renaissance and late seventeenth century. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Introductions to the material, biographical background and secondary sources enhance this important collection. &lt;i&gt;Women Theorists on Society and Politics&lt;/i&gt; provides essential theory on standard topics and a balance to the anthologies of feminist writing now more commonly available. &lt;/p&gt;" />
