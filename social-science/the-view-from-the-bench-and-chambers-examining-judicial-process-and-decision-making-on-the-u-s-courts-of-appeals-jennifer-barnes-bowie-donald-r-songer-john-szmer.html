  <title>The View from the Bench and Chambers: Examining Judicial Process and Decision Making on the U.S. Courts of Appeals - Jennifer Barnes Bowie, Donald R. Songer, John Szmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of their history, the U.S. courts of appeals have toiled in     obscurity, well out of the limelight of political controversy. But as the number of appeals has     increased dramatically, while the number of cases heard by the Supreme Court has remained the     same, the courts of appeals have become the court of last resort for the vast majority of     litigants. This enhanced status has been recognized by important political actors, and as a     result, appointments to the courts of appeals have become more and more contentious since the     1990s. This combination of increasing political salience and increasing political controversy     has led to the rise of serious empirical studies of the role of the courts of appeals in our     legal and political system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At once building on and contributing to this wave     of scholarship, &lt;i&gt;The View from the Bench and Chambers&lt;/i&gt; melds a series of     quantitative analyses of judicial decisions with the perspectives gained from in-depth     interviews with the judges and their law clerks. This multifaceted approach yields a level of     insight beyond that provided by any previous work on appellate courts in the United States,     making &lt;i&gt;The View from the Bench and Chambers&lt;/i&gt; the most comprehensive and rich     account of the operation of these courts to date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
