  <title>When the Echo Dies - Dean C. Waldt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In June 2015, the Supreme Court declared that marriage violates the United States Constitution. The federal court marriage decisions, culminating in the 2015 Supreme Court decision, are a symptom of a potentially fatal condition impacting American society. The foundation of the American experiment in self-government is a common core of objective foundational truths. These are not sectarian or doctrinal truths. Rather, they are the echo of the Judeo-Christian principles that have been the basic foundation stones of Western civilization. In When the Echo Dies, recent federal court cases overturning State laws and State constitutional amendments on civil marriage and the Supreme Court cases finding traditional civil marriage to be an unconstitutional institution are examined in detail to determine whether the premises used by the federal courts are a reflection or a rejection of the foundational echo that gave birth to America. The examination of these decisions leads to the inevitable conclusion that much of the federal judiciary and the majority of the Supreme Court has either lost the ability to hear the foundational echo or actively reject it. Whether from active choice or passive disability, the end result is a form of judicial tyranny, as the federal courts usurp the American democratic process.
But it is not too late. We must rediscover and reengage the echo to preserve the American experiment. This involves many voices in a pluralistic society. We must reject the gag order of political correctness and have the conversation. Forced conformity, moral nihilism, utopian social planning, and the raw use of governmental power to build a better world has never yielded a good result. Only a people who together hear the echo of foundational objective truths can self-govern. We must become that people once again. America is at risk. When the echo dies, so does America." />
