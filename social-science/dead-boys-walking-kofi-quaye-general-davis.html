  <title>Dead Boys Walking - Kofi Quaye, General Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It doesnt take much to become a dead boy walking in America or elsewhere and on a collision course with early death or some other form of youth related violence. For a young African-American named Trayvon Martin, all it took was to run into a young white wanna be police packing a gun and willing to use it.  He was shot to death in Sanford, Florida in a tragic case which exploded into the headlines in March  2012.  For others, it is driving a nice car in a white neighborhood in a major American city, the way it happened to Syracuse native, Johnnie Gamage in Pittsburgh. He was shot and killed by Pittsburgh police. He was driving a Jaguar owned by his uncle, Ray Seals, formerly of Pittsburgh Steelers football team
For Stanley Tookie Williams, popular for all the wrong reasons yet nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, it is for crimes he was charged with and executed as the leader of the CRIPS gang in Los Angeles. For many others too many list to list here, it is being at the wrong place at the wrong time when a drive by-shooting occurs. For many more around the globe, you are a dead boy walking when you are born in a war torn country and are forced into an army as a child soldier." />
