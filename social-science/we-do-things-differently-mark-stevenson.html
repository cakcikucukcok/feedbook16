  <title>We Do Things Differently - Mark Stevenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Our systems are failing. Old models--for  education, healthcare and government, food production, energy supply--are  creaking under the weight of modern challenges. As the world&#39;s population heads  towards 10 billion, it&#39;s clear we need new approaches. In We Do Things Differently, historian and futurologist Mark Stevenson  sets out to find them, across four continents. From  Brazilian favelas to high tech Boston, from rural India to a shed inventor in  England&#39;s home counties,Â Mark Stevenson travels the world to  find the advance guard re-imagining our future. At each stop, he meets  innovators who have already succeeded in challenging the status quo, pioneering  new ways to make our world more sustainable, equitable and humane.  Populated  by extraordinary characters--including Detroit citizens who created new jobs and  promoted healthy eating by building greenhouses, an Austrian mayor who built a  new biomass plant using the by-product of a local flooring company, and an  Indian doctor who crowdsourced his research and  published his findings online--We Do Things DifferentlyÂ paints a riveting picture of what  can be done to address the world&#39;s most pressing dilemmas, offering a much  needed dose of down-to-earth optimism. It is a window on (and a roadmap to) a  different and better future.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
