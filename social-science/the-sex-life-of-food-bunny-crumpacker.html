  <title>The Sex Life of Food - Bunny Crumpacker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;The sex life of food&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that the strawberries have fallen in love with the oatmeal. It&#39;s a look at food--and sex--and how they go together in our daily lives much more often than we realize. There are so many ways that hunger and desire act on each other, and so many things that can influence our preferences. Not only are people moved by the taste, texture, and the shapes of the food they eat, but even the names of some dishes can kindle hunger--of both kinds--in some. As the author writes, &quot;Sometimes cooking is foreplay, eating is making love, and doing the dishes is the morning after.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The many things Bunny Crumpacker shares with the readers of her fascinating book almost could have inspired her to write a novel, sending Adam and Eve (with their apple) traveling through history as the icons of our passions. Instead, she has gone far beyond the obvious to bring us unexpected and tantalizing knowledge of how much and in how many surprising ways we assuage our hunger for both food and sex and how where there&#39;s one, there is often the other. The result is a continued delight. There&#39;s history and humor, obvious connections and truly amazing ones. The author enlightens us on a myriad of topics, including food in fairy tales, what politicians eat, comfort food, and manners at the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But enough! There&#39;s too much to say. Turn the pages and let Bunny Crumpacker introduce you to &lt;i&gt;The Sex Life of Food&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
