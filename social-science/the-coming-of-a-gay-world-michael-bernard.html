The uprising of this power can tranquilize anything; it will be a world full of unbelievable situation, and the euphoria of gays is on top of the equation. For who want to think one way or another homosexual is a fashion to a man and woman relationship, gays are more committed to their relationship than any woman and man relationship, this is a fact, researched are logic, not assumption. If love itself cannot be sentimental in any fashion, then love is not love, love does not mean what it is for, if love found its way in the arms of homosexual and it is wrong then love is not love, love should be anywhere it find itself. Love and homosexual is two separate force, love is love by itself, homosexual is homosexual by itself, so love by itself can&#39;t be nothing else, it has to remained has love. &quot;Is not love find homosexual, is homosexual find love,&quot; The author owe no apology for any criticism. part two coming soon!!!" />
