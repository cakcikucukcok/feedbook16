  <title>The Ecotechnic Future - John Michael Greer</title>

And he wields uncommon writing skills, making his diagnosis and prescription entertaining, illuminating, and practically informative. Not to be missed.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&lt;B&gt;Richard Heinberg&lt;/B&gt;, Senior Fellow, Post Carbon Institute and author of &lt;I&gt;Peak Everything&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is a great deal of conventional wisdom about our collective ecological crisis out there in books.&amp;#160; The enormous virtue of &lt;B&gt;John Michael Greer&amp;rsquo;&lt;/B&gt;s work is that his wisdom is never conventional, but profound and imaginative.&amp;#160; There&amp;rsquo;s no one who makes me think harder,&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;&lt;B&gt;The Ecotechnic&amp;#160;Future&lt;/B&gt; pushes Greer&amp;rsquo;s vision, and our thought processes in important directions.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;B&gt;Sharon Astyk&lt;/B&gt;, farmer, blogger, and author of &lt;I&gt;Depletion and Abundance&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;and &lt;I&gt;A Nation of&amp;#160;Farmers&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In &lt;B&gt;The Ecotechnic Future&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;B&gt;John Michael Greer&lt;/B&gt; dispels our fantasies of a tidy, controlled transition from industrial society to a post-industrial milieu. The process will be ragged and rugged and will not invariably constitute an evolutionary leap for the human species. It will, however, offer myriad opportunities to create a society that bolsters complex technology which at the same time maintains a sustainable interaction with the ecosystem. Greer brilliantly inspires us to integrate the two in our thinking and to construct local communities which concretely exemplify this comprehensive vision.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;B&gt;Carolyn Baker,&lt;/B&gt; author of &lt;I&gt;Sacred Demise: Walking The Spiritual Path of Industrial Civilization&amp;rsquo;s Collapse&lt;/I&gt;, and publisher/editor, &lt;I&gt;Speaking Truth to Power&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the coming impact of peak oil, &lt;B&gt;John Michael Greer&lt;/B&gt; helps us envision the transition from an industrial society to a sustainable ecotechnic world&amp;mdash;not returning to the past, but creating a society that supports relatively advanced technology on a sustainable resource base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fusing human ecology and history, this book challenges assumptions held by mainstream and alternative thinkers about the evolution of human societies. Human societies, like ecosystems, evolve in complex and unpredictable ways, making it futile to try to impose rigid ideological forms on the patterns of evolutionary change. Instead, social change must explore many pathways over which we have no control. The troubling and exhilarating prospect of an open-ended future, he proposes, requires dissensus&amp;mdash;a deliberate acceptance of radical diversity that widens the range of potential approaches to infinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in three parts, the book places the present crisis of the industrial world in its historical and ecological context in part one; part two explores the toolkit for the Ecotechnic Age; and part three opens a door to the complexity of future visions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone concerned about peak oil and the future of industrial society, this book provides a solid analysis of how we got to where we are and offers a practical toolkit to prepare for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;John Michael Greer&lt;/B&gt; is a certified Master Conserver, organic gardener, and scholar of ecological history.
